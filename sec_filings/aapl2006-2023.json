        "item1a": ">Item 1A. Risk\nFactors\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the following\nfactors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s operating results and\nfinancial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be\na reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use\nhistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\n\n\n\nThe matters relating to the investigation by the\nSpecial Committee of the Board of Directors and the restatement of the Company\u0092s\nconsolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation and governmental\nenforcement actions.\n\n\n\n\nOn June\u00a029, 2006, the Company announced that an\ninternal review had discovered irregularities related to the issuance of\ncertain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001, including a grant to\nits Chief Executive Officer (\u0093CEO\u0094), Steve Jobs. The Company also announced a\nSpecial Committee of outside directors (\u0093Special Committee\u0094) had been formed\nand had hired independent counsel to conduct a full investigation of the\nCompany\u0092s past stock option granting practices.\u00a0As described in the\nExplanatory Note immediately preceding Part\u00a0I, Item\u00a01, and in Note 2 \u0093Restatement\nof Consolidated Financial Statements\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements in this Form\u00a010-K, as a result of the internal review and\nindependent investigation, management has concluded, and the Audit and Finance\nCommittee agrees, that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial\naccounting purposes for stock option grants made in \n\n\n\n\n20\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncertain prior periods. As a result, the Company has\nrecorded additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and related tax\neffects, with regard to certain past stock option grants, and the Company has restated\ncertain previously filed financial statements included in this Form\u00a010-K.\n\n\n\n\nThe internal review, the independent investigation,\nand related activities have required the Company to incur substantial expenses\nfor legal, accounting, tax and other professional services, have diverted\nmanagement\u0092s attention from the Company\u0092s business, and could in the future harm\nits business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Company believes it has made appropriate\njudgments in determining the correct measurement dates for its stock option\ngrants, the SEC may disagree with the manner in which the Company has accounted\nfor and reported, or not reported, the financial impact. Accordingly, there is\na risk the Company may have to further restate its prior financial statements,\namend prior filings with the SEC, or take other actions not currently\ncontemplated.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s past stock option granting practices and\nthe restatement of prior financial statements have exposed the Company to\ngreater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government\nenforcement actions. As described in Part\u00a0I, Item 3, \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094,\nseveral derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in\nstate and federal courts against the Company\u0092s directors and certain of its\nexecutive officers pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants.\nThe Company has provided the results of its internal review and independent\ninvestigation to the SEC and the United States Attorney\u0092s Office for the\nNorthern District of California, and in that regard the Company has responded\nto informal requests for documents and additional information. The Company\nintends to continue full cooperation. No assurance can be given regarding the\noutcomes from litigation, regulatory proceedings or government enforcement\nactions relating to the Company\u0092s past stock option practices. The resolution\nof these matters will be time consuming, expensive, and will distract\nmanagement from the conduct of the Company\u0092s business. Furthermore, if the\nCompany is subject to adverse findings in litigation, regulatory proceedings or\ngovernment enforcement actions, the Company could be required to pay damages or\npenalties or have other remedies imposed, which could harm its business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\n\n\nIn August\u00a02006, the\nCompany received a NASDAQ Staff Determination letter stating that, as a result\nof the delayed filing of the Company\u0092s Form\u00a010-Q for the quarter\nended July\u00a01, 2006 (the \u0093Third Quarter Form\u00a010-Q\u0094), the Company\nwas not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set\nforth in Marketplace Rule\u00a04310(c)(14) and was therefore subject to\ndelisting from the NASDAQ Stock Market.\u00a0On October\u00a024, 2006, the\nNASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel granted the Company\u0092s request for continued\nlisting, subject to the Company filing\u00a0the Third Quarter Form\u00a010-Q,\nand any required restatements, with the SEC by December\u00a029, 2006. On December\u00a029,\n2006, the Company filed the Third Quarter Form\u00a010-Q with the SEC. With\nthe filing of this Form\u00a010-K, the Company believes that it has\nremedied its non-compliance with Marketplace Rule\u00a04310(c)(14), subject to\nNASDAQ\u0092s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its\nnotification of the Company accordingly. However, if the SEC disagrees with the\nmanner in which the Company has accounted for and reported, or not reported,\nthe financial impact of past stock option grants, there could be further delays\nin filing subsequent SEC reports that might result in delisting of the Company\u0092s\ncommon stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market.\n\n\n\n\nUnfavorable results\nof legal proceedings could adversely affect the Company\u0092s results of\noperations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that are discussed in Part\u00a0I, Item 3\nof this Form\u00a010-K. The Company is also subject to certain other\nlegal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and which have not been fully adjudicated. Results of legal\nproceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. In addition, litigation may be\ndisruptive to the Company\u0092s normal \n\n\n\n\n21\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbusiness operations. Should\nthe Company fail to prevail in certain legal matters, the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition, liquidity, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nEconomic conditions and political events could\nadversely affect the demand for the Company\u0092s products and the financial health\nof its suppliers, distributors, and resellers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s operating\nperformance depends significantly on economic conditions in the U.S. and\nabroad. At times in the past, demand for the Company\u0092s products has been\nnegatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Uncertainty about\nfuture economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the\nCompany\u0092s products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional\neconomic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company\u0092s products could be\nadversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers,\ndistributors, and resellers.\n\n\n\n\nWar, terrorism, public health issues, and other\ncircumstances could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products, which\ncould negatively affect the Company\u0092s operations and performance.\n\n\n\n\nWar, terrorism, public health issues, and other\nbusiness interruptions, whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could\ncause damage or disruption to international \n\ncommerce\nand global economy, and thus may have a strong negative impact on the global\neconomy, \n\nthe Company, and the Company\u0092s suppliers or customers. The\nCompany\u0092s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake,\nother natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other\nhostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its\ncontrol. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its\ncorporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical\nbusiness operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing\nvendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not\ncarry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company\u0092s\noperating results and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or man-made\ndisaster.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it is impossible\nto predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events\ncould result in a decrease in demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it\ndifficult or impossible for the Company to deliver products to its customers or\nto receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies\nin the Company\u0092s supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues\nincluding pandemics arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more\nstringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the\navailability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of\nproducts between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products,\nand disruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and\ncomponent suppliers. The Company\u0092s operating results and financial condition\nhave been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by such events.\n\n\n\n\nThe market for personal computers and related\nperipherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related\nservices, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively\ncompete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive\nand is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on\ngross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life\ncycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product\nprice/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product\nadvancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a\nlarge number of competitors. Price competition in the market for personal computers\nand related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell\nWindows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and\nlowered their product margins for personal computing products. The Company\u0092s\nresults of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may\ncontinue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing\npressures and downward pressures on gross margins.\n\n\n\n\n22\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe personal computer industry has also been\ncharacterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality,\nhardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry\nstandards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place\nmore reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that\nare smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for\nmarket share with the Company\u0092s existing products. Several competitors of the\nCompany have targeted certain of the Company\u0092s key market segments, including\nconsumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and\ndesign and publishing. Several of the Company\u0092s competitors have introduced\ndigital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution\nthat mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the\nCompany\u0092s products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many\nof whom have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than\nthose of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards\nconsolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and\npotentially stronger competitors in the Company\u0092s markets.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is currently the only maker of hardware\nusing the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal\ncomputer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing competing\noperating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Company\u0092s future operating\nresults and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to\ncontinue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform to maintain\nperceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. Additionally,\nif unauthorized copies of the Mac OS are used on other companies\u0092 hardware\nproducts and result in decreased demand for the Company\u0092s hardware products,\nthe Company\u0092s results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is currently focused on market\nopportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer\nelectronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces significant competition\nfrom other companies promoting their own digital music products including MP3\nplayers, music enabled cell phones, free peer-to-peer music and video services,\nand free streaming of digital content via the Internet. These competitors\ninclude both new entrants with different market approaches, such as\nsubscription services models, and also larger companies that may have\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources, as well as\nestablished hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships.\nFailure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company\u0092s operating\nresults and financial position. The Company expects competition in this space\nto intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to\ntightly integrating these components within their individual offerings or work\nmore collaboratively with each other to offer solutions that are more\nintegrated than those they offer currently. Some of these current and potential\ncompetitors have substantial resources and may be able to provide such products\nand services at little or no profit or even at a loss to compete with the\nCompany\u0092s offerings. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to\ncontinue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these\nmarkets. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering\nprices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nmusic product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company also faces\nsignificant competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and\nsecondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core\nmarket for the Company. In an effort to gain market share and remain\ncompetitive, the Company will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning\nsolutions in education. \n\n1:1 learning\nsolutions\n\n typically consist of a\nportable computer for every student and teacher along with the installation of\na wireless network\n\n. \n\nThese 1:1\nlearning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more\naggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or financial\nlosses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has\ntaken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there\ncan be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its\nshare of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic \n\n\n\n\n23\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narrangements. Failure to\ndo so may have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results are dependent upon the\nCompany\u0092s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including\nmicroprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from\nlimited sources.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most components\nessential to the Company\u0092s business are generally available from multiple\nsources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are\ncurrently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key\ncomponents (including without limitation DRAM, NAND flash-memory, and TFT-LCD\nflat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple\nsources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures.\nIn addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize\ncustom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated\nwhether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers.\nIn situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers\u0092 yields have\nmatured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer and consumer\nelectronics industries also compete for various components with other\nindustries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The\nCompany uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal\ncomputer or consumer electronics industries. Continued availability of these\ncomponents may be affected if producers decided to concentrate on the\nproduction of components other than those customized to meet the Company\u0092s\nrequirements. If the supply of a key component were delayed or constrained on a\nnew or existing product, the Company\u0092s results of operations and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company must successfully manage frequent product\nintroductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate\ncustomer demand.\n\n\n\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of\nthe personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are\ncharacterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological\nadvances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies,\nenhance existing products to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate\ncustomer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Company\u0092s\nexisting products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a\nnumber of factors, including market acceptance; the Company\u0092s ability to manage\nthe risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to\nIntel-based Macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability\nof application software for new products; the effective management of purchase\ncommitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand; the\navailability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet\nanticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other\ndefects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot\ndetermine in advance the ultimate effect new products will have on its sales or\nresults of operations.\n\n\n\n\nIn June\u00a02005, the\nCompany announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its\ncomputers. During 2006, the Company introduced new Intel-based models of the\nMacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac, and Mac mini computers. The Company\u0092s\ntransition to Intel microprocessors for Macintosh systems was completed in August\u00a02006,\nand its transition for Xserve was completed in November\u00a02006. This\ntransition has been and will continue to be subject to numerous risks and\nuncertainties including the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware\nand software products to support Intel microprocessors, market acceptance of\nIntel-based Macintosh computers, and the development and availability on\nacceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to\ntimely deliver Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company is\ndependent on third-party software developers such as Microsoft and Adobe to\ntimely develop current and future applications that run on Intel-based\nMacintosh computers. Universal versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe\u0092s\nCreative Suite\u00a0applications are not currently available. Additionally,\nthere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its \n\n\n\n\n24\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhistorical gross margin\npercentages on its products, including Intel-based Macintosh computers, which\nmay adversely impact the Company\u0092s results of operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products from time to time experience\nquality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company sells highly\ncomplex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and\nmanufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as\nthose sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere\nwith the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and\nproducts the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance\nthat the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and\nsoftware it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of\nreputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy.\n\n\n\n\nBecause orders for components, and in some cases\ncommitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer\norders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company records a write-down for inventories of\ncomponents and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of\nanticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for\ncancellation fees for orders of products and components that have been\ncancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions\nare currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product\nobsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the\ntransition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that\nthe Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In\naddition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company\u0092s\nfinancial position and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order\ncomponents for its products and build inventory in advance of product\nshipments. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile and subject to rapid\ntechnology and price changes, and because of the transition to Intel-based\nMacintosh computers, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and\nproduce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of\nparticular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally\nacquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open\norders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments\ntypically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company\u0092s operating\nresults and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be\nmaterially adversely affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory\nlevels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is dependent on manufacturing and\nlogistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside\nof the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the Company\u0092s products are manufactured in\nwhole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has\noutsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing\narrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Company\u0092s\ndirect control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect\nsuch diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products\nmanufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond\nto changing market conditions. In addition, the Company is reliant on\nthird-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company\u0092s supplier code of conduct. Moreover,\nalthough arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for\nwarranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially\nresponsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product\ndefects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether\npursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could\nadversely affect the Company\u0092s future operating results and financial\ncondition.\n\n\n\n\n25\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal assembly of products\nsold by the Company is currently performed in the Company\u0092s manufacturing\nfacility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California;\nFullerton, California; Taiwan; the Republic of Korea; the People\u0092s Republic of\nChina; and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the\ncomponents used in the Company\u0092s products is performed by third-party vendors\nin Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially\nall of the Company\u0092s portable products, including MacBook Pros, MacBooks, and\niPods, is performed by third-party vendors in China. If for any reason\nmanufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional\neconomic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,\nor due to information technology system failures or military actions, the Company\u0092s\nresults of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future operating performance is\ndependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company\u0092s\nproducts.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through\nwholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many\nof whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the\nCompany sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in\nmost of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers,\nand certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail\nstores. Many of the Company\u0092s resellers operate on narrow product margins and\nhave been negatively impacted in the past by weak economic conditions.\nConsiderable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit\ninsurance are outstanding with the Company\u0092s distribution and retail channel\npartners. The Company\u0092s business and financial results could be adversely\naffected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers\nwithin consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company\u0092s products,\nor if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products caused resellers\nto reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u0092s products. The Company\nhas invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance\nreseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company\nemployees and contractors. These programs could require a substantial\ninvestment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or\nincremental revenue to offset this investment.\n\n\n\n\nOver the past several\nyears, an increasing proportion of the Company\u0092s net sales have been made by\nthe Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world\nand through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Some of\nthe Company\u0092s resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company\u0092s direct\nsales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as\ndistributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Perception of such a\nconflict could discourage the Company\u0092s resellers from investing additional\nresources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them\nto limit or cease distribution of the Company\u0092s products. The Company\u0092s\nbusiness and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its\ndirect sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit\ndistribution of the Company\u0092s products.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies\non third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company contracts with third parties to offer\ntheir digital content to customers through the Company\u0092s iTunes Store. The\nCompany pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers\nthis third-party digital content. The Company\u0092s licensing arrangements with\nthese third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee\nthe future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if\nat all. Certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed\nalliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to\noffer digital content to customers through the iTunes Store. Some third-party\ncontent providers currently or may in the future offer music products and\nservices that compete with the Company\u0092s music products and services, and could\ntake action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license\ntheir digital content in the future. Further, other distributors of third-party\ncontent or third-party content owners may seek to limit \n\n\n\n\n26\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Company\u0092s access to or increase the total cost of\nsuch content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of\ndigital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue\nto expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins\nof the Company\u0092s iTunes Store, as well as related hardware and peripherals,\nincluding iPods, may be adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThird-party content\nproviders and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights\nmanagement (\u0093DRM\u0094) solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements\nfrom content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to\nfurther develop or license technology to address such new rights and\nrequirements. In addition, certain countries have passed legislation or may\npropose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM solutions\nso that content would be interoperable with competitor devices, which could\nlessen the protection of content subjecting it to piracy and could affect\narrangements with the Company\u0092s content suppliers. There is no assurance the\nCompany will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost\nand in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect\non the Company\u0092s operating results and financial position.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance is dependent upon\nsupport from third-party software developers. If third-party software\napplications cease to be developed or available for the Company\u0092s hardware\nproducts, then customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to\npurchase the Company\u0092s personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based\nsystems, are often based on the availability of third-party software\napplications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the\navailability of third-party application software for the Company\u0092s\nhardware products depends in part on third-party developers\u0092 perception\nand analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading\nsuch software for the Company\u0092s products versus software for the larger Windows\nmarket or growing Linux market. This analysis may be based on factors such as\nthe perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated\npotential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac\nOS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the\nminority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has\ncaused software developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects in the personal\ncomputer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application\nsoftware or upgrade existing software for the Company\u0092s products and more\ninclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the\nlarger Windows market or growing Linux market. The Company\u0092s recent\nannouncement that it plans to add a feature to the next version of Mac OS X\nthat will enable Intel-based Macintosh systems to run Windows XP may deter\ndevelopers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such\napplications are available for the Windows platform. Moreover, there can be no\nassurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X on\na timely basis or at all.\n\n\n\n\nIn June\u00a02005, the Company announced its plan to\nbegin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Company\nintroduced new Intel-based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac,\nand Mac mini computers. The Company\u0092s transition to Intel microprocessors for\nMacintosh systems was completed in August\u00a02006, and its transition for\nXserve was completed in November\u00a02006. The Company depends on third-party\nsoftware developers to timely develop current and future applications that run\non Intel microprocessors. Universal versions of Microsoft Office and Adobe\u0092s\nCreative Suite\u00a0applications are not currently available. The lack of\napplications that run on Intel-based Macintosh systems, including Microsoft\nOffice and Adobe Creative Suite, could have a materially adverse effect on the\nCompany\u0092s operating results and financial position.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, past and\nfuture development by the Company of its own software applications and\nsolutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as\nMicrosoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software\nfor the Company\u0092s products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety\nof software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education\ncustomers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers\nto develop or \n\n\n\n\n27\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupgrade\nMacintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently\nmarketed by the Company include software for professional film and video\nediting, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and\nvideo productions, professional music production and music post production,\nprofessional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, professional digital\nphoto editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo\nediting and management, digital music management, desktop-based database\nmanagement, word processing, and high-quality presentations. Discontinuance of\nthird-party software products for the Macintosh platform could have an adverse\neffect on the Company\u0092s net sales and results of operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business relies on access to patents and\nintellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company\u0092s future\nresults could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed\non the intellectual property rights of others.\n\n\n\n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products are designed to include\nintellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in\nthe future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its\nproducts and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past\nexperience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on\ncommercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the\nnecessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms.\n\n\n\n\nBecause of technological\nchanges in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive\npatent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible\ncertain components of the Company\u0092s products and business methods may\nunknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to\ntime been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other\nintellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless\nof their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and\ncause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending\nclaims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the\ndesirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases.\nHowever, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a\ntemporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from\nmarketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of\ninfringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a\nthird-party, the Company\u0092s future operating results and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and\nlitigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and\nother matters is set forth in Part\u00a0I, Item 3 of this Form\u00a010-K.\nIn the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability\nfor damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related\nto the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others\nthat would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on\nits results of operations or financial condition. However, the results of such\nlegal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail\nto prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other\nintellectual property rights of others described in Part\u00a0I, Item 3 of this\nForm\u00a010-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the\nCompany in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular\nreporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s retail initiative has required and will\ncontinue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is\nsubject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\nThrough September\u00a030, 2006, the Company had\nopened 165 retail stores. The Company\u0092s retail initiative has required\nsubstantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information\nsystems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into\nsubstantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms\nranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company\ncould incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate these commitments\nor close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nresults of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high\nproportion of the Retail segment\u0092s costs are fixed because of personnel costs, \n\n\n\n\n28\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndepreciation of store construction costs, and lease\nexpense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment\nexperience a significant decline in sales for any reason.\n\n\n\n\nCertain of the Company\u0092s stores\nhave been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues that \n\nfunction\nas vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand\nawareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these\nstores require substantially more investment in \n\nequipment and leasehold improvements than the Company\u0092s more typical\nretail stores. The Company has opened eight such stores through September\u00a02006.\nBecause of their location and size, these high-profile stores also require the\nCompany to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared\nto those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations\nhave terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total remaining commitments per location\nranging from $4 million to $33 million. Closure or poor performance of one of\nthese high-profile stores could have a significant negative impact on the\nCompany\u0092s results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\nMany of the general risks\nand uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its\nRetail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present\n\n risks and uncertainties, \n\nsome of which\nare beyond the Company\u0092s control, that could adversely affect the Retail\nsegment\u0092s future results, cause its actual results to differ from those\ncurrently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated\nresults of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail\noperations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include,\namong other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on\ngeneral retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store\nconstruction and operation; inability to sell third-party hardware and software\nproducts at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing\nretail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations\noutside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value\nof Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain and\nrenew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\n\n\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives\ncould disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and may present risks not originally\ncontemplated.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has and may in\nthe future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that\ncomplement the Company\u0092s strategic direction and product roadmap. Such\nendeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including\ndistraction of management\u0092s attention away from current business operations;\ninsufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses\nassociated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the\nCompany\u0092s due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently\nrisky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be\nsuccessful and will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s business,\noperating results or financial condition.\n\n\n\n\nDeclines in the sales of the Company\u0092s professional\nproducts, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases\nin sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the\nCompany\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s professional products, including MacBook\nPro and Mac Pro systems, software, accessories, and service and support\ncontracts, generally have higher gross margins than the Company\u0092s consumer\nproducts, including the iMac, Mac mini, MacBook, iPod, and content from the\niTunes Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional\nproducts towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the\nCompany\u0092s future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company\u0092s\ntraditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products,\nspecifically the iMac and MacBook, instead of professional products.\nProfessional users may choose to buy the iMac due to its relative price\nperformance and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Professional users\nmay also choose to purchase MacBooks instead of the Company\u0092s\nprofessional-oriented portable products due to their price performance and\nscreen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without \n\n\n\n\n29\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorresponding growth in higher margin product sales\ncould also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company expects\nits quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of\nreasons.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s profit\nmargins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company\u0092s\ndirect sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have\nhigher associated profitability than its indirect sales. As a result, the\nCompany\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall\nprofitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product,\ngeographic or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the\ntransition to Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company\ngenerally sells more product during the third month of each quarter than it\ndoes during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal\ncomputer and consumer electronics industries. This sales pattern can produce\npressure on the Company\u0092s internal infrastructure during the third month of a\nquarter and may adversely impact the Company\u0092s ability to predict its financial\nresults accurately. Furthermore, the Company has typically experienced greater\nnet sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in\nthe fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the\nbeginning of the school year. Developments late in a quarter, such as\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, an internal systems\nfailure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s key logistics, components\nsuppliers, or manufacturing partners, could have significant adverse impacts on\nthe Company and its results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has higher research and development and\nselling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than\nmany of its competitors.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to\ncompete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth\nis heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of\ninnovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a\nresult, the Company generally incurs higher research and development costs as a\npercentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on\nother operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively\non price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the\nexpansion of the Company\u0092s Retail segment and costs associated with marketing\nthe Company\u0092s brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs\nhigher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors.\nIf the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new\nproducts with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be\nmaterially adversely affected by its operating cost structure.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts\nreceivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is\nheightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes\nits products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly\nto certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial\nmajority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by\ncollateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade\nreceivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale\nby the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture\nsub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the\nCompany has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND\nflash-memory and has prepaid a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements.\nWhile the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to\ncredit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term\nprepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will be effective in\nlimiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global\neconomy or regional economies deteriorate, the Company would be more likely to\nincur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial\ncondition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors.\n\n\n\n\n30\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s\nsuccess depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel.\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the future success\nof the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled\npersonnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive\nteam, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced\npersonnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and\ncompetition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley,\nwhere the majority of the Company\u0092s key employees are located. The Company has\nrelied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting\nand retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations\nrequiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based\ncompensation expense, which may cause the Company to reduce the amount of\nstock-based awards issued to employees. There can be no assurance that the\nCompany will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject\nto risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance.\n\n\n\n\nFor certain risks, the\nCompany does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or\navailability. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks,\nand in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in\nexcess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s\nresults of operations and financial position.\n\n\n\n\nFailure of information technology systems and breaches\nin the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the\nCompany\u0092s future operating results.\n\n\n\n\nInformation technology\nsystem failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company\u0092s\nability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing\ndelays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment\nof products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or\nCompany information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its\nown systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control\nmeasures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data\nsecurity breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u0092s results of operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s\nbusiness is subject to the risks of international operations.\n\n\n\n\nA large portion of the Company\u0092s revenue is derived\nfrom its international operations. As a result, the Company\u0092s operating results\nand financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated\nwith international activities, including economic and labor conditions,\npolitical instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries),\nand changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which\nthe products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company\u0092s\nprimary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to\nnon-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and\ncertain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred\nthroughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the\nJapanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the\nCompany\u0092s products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency\ndenominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign\ncurrencies can cause the Company to modify international pricing and affect the\nvalue of the Company\u0092s foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also\nincrease the cost to the Company of some product components.\n\n\n\n\nMargins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign\ncountries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from\nforeign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and\nantidumping penalties.\n\n\n\n\nDerivative instruments, such as foreign exchange\nforward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge\nexposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such\nhedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial\nimpact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\n31\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther information related\nto the Company\u0092s global market risks may be found in Part\u00a0II, Item 7A of\nthis Form\u00a010-K under the subheading \u0093Foreign Currency Risk\u0094 and may\nbe found in Part\u00a0II, Item 8 of this Form\u00a010-K at Notes 1 and 3\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is\nsubject to risks associated with environmental regulations.\n\n\n\n\nProduction and marketing\nof products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to\nenvironmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the\nrequirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of\nits useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or\nrecycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed\nin several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various\nEuropean Union member countries, Japan and certain states within the U.S.\nAlthough the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the\nfuture based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there\nis no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition, liquidity, or results of\noperations.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in\naccounting rules\u00a0could affect the Company\u0092s future operating results.\n\n\n\n\nFinancial statements are\nprepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nThese principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies,\nincluding the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u0093FASB\u0094) and the SEC, who\ncreate and interpret appropriate accounting standards. A change from current\naccounting standards could have a significant effect on the Company\u0092s results\nof operations. In December\u00a02004, the FASB issued new guidance that\naddresses the accounting for share-based payments, Statement of Financial\nAccounting Standards (\u0093SFAS\u0094) No.\u00a0123 (revised 2004) (\u0093SFAS\u00a0No. 123R\u0094),\n\n\nShare-Based Payment\n\n, which the Company\nadopted in 2006. In 2006, stock-based compensation expense reduced diluted\nearnings per common share by approximately $0.14. Although the adoption of SFAS\nNo.\u00a0123R is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the\nCompany\u0092s results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to\ndetermine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity\nawards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based\ncompensation expense.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in the\nCompany\u0092s tax rates could affect its future results.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future\neffective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in\nthe mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in\nthe valuation of the Company\u0092s deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by\nchanges in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is\nsubject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine\nthe adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance the\noutcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on\nthe Company\u0092s results of operations and financial condition.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock\nprice may be volatile.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock has at\ntimes experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations\nbetween its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of\nannouncements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has\nexperienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market\nprice of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the\noperating performance of these companies. Furthermore, the Company believes its\nstock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the\nCompany fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly\ndecline. In addition, increases in the Company\u0092s stock price may result in\ngreater dilution of earnings per share.\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7": ">Item 7. Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations\n\n\n\n\nThis section and\nother parts of this Form\u00a010-K contain forward-looking\nstatements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can\nalso be identified by words such as \u0093anticipates,\u0094 \u0093expects,\u0094 \u0093believes,\u0094 \u0093plans,\u0094\n\u0093predicts,\u0094 and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of\nfuture performance and the Company\u0092s actual results may differ significantly\nfrom the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors\nthat might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those\ndiscussed in the subsection entitled \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 above. The following\ndiscussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial\nstatements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form\u00a010-K.\nAll information presented herein is based on the Company\u0092s fiscal calendar.\nUnless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or\nquarters refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September\u00a0and the\nassociated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to\nrevise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as\nrequired by law.\n\n\n\n\nThe following information\nhas been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the Company\u0092s financial\nresults, which is more fully described in the \u0093Explanatory Note\u0094 immediately\npreceding Part\u00a0I, Item 1 and in Note\u00a02, \u0093Restatement of Consolidated\nFinancial Statements\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form\u00a010-K.\nThe net of tax impact of the adjustments, which amounted to $4 million in 2006,\nwas recorded by the Company in its fourth quarter of 2006. The net of tax\nimpact of the restatements on the Company\u0092s results of operations amounted to\n$7 million and $10 million in 2005 and 2004, \n\n\n\n\n48\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespectively. The impact\nof these adjustments was not significant to the Company\u0092s operating results,\ntrends, or liquidity for the annual or quarterly periods in 2006, 2005, and\n2004.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Overview\n\n\n\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets\npersonal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking\nsolutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable\ndigital music players along with related accessories and services including the\nonline distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short\nfilms, television shows, movies, and iPod games. The Company\u0092s products and\nservices include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod\nline of portable digital music players, the Xserve server and Xserve RAID\nstorage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software\napplications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Store, a portfolio of\nperipherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and\na variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its\nproducts worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct\nsales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.\nIn addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh and iPod\ncompatible products including application software, printers, storage devices,\nspeakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through its\nonline and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative\nprofessional, business, and government customers. A further description of the\nCompany\u0092s products may be found in Part\u00a0I, Item 1 of this Form\u00a010-K\nunder the heading \u0093Business.\u0094\n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes that for both professionals and\nconsumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digital\nlifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devices\nsuch as the Company\u0092s iPods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, CD\nand DVD players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and other\nconsumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer that\nenable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access to\nrelatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications,\nand the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devices\nand to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personal\ncomputer industry that controls the design and development of the entire\npersonal computer\u0097from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated\napplications. This, along with its products\u0092 innovative industrial designs,\nintuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networking\ncapabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrated\ndigital lifestyle solutions.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business strategy leverages its ability,\nthrough the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many\nsoftware applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the\nworld compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless\nintegration, and innovative industrial design.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive\nmarkets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers,\nconsumer electronics with its iPod line of portable digital music players, and\ndistribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While\nthe Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and\nconsumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for\ndistribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that\nare subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. To remain\ncompetitive, the Company believes increased investment in research and\ndevelopment (\u0093R&D\u0094) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain\nand extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Company\u0092s R&D\nspending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its\nexisting line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software\napplications, and portable digital music players; developing new digital\nlifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new\nproduct areas such as rack-mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless\ntechnologies. The Company also believes investment in marketing and advertising\nprograms is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June\u00a02005, the Company announced its plan to\nbegin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Company\nintroduced new Intel-based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac,\nand Mac mini computers. The Company\u0092s transition to Intel microprocessors for\nMacintosh systems was completed in August\u00a02006, and its transition for\nXserve was completed in November\u00a02006. The MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro,\niMac, and Mac mini feature Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger, iLife \u009106, and the\nCompany\u0092s new translation technology, Rosetta, which allows most PowerPC-based\nMacintosh applications to run on Intel-based Macintosh computers. There are\npotential risks and uncertainties that may occur due to this transition, which\nare further discussed in Item 1A under the heading \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094\n\n\n\n\nThe Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect\ndistribution channels. The Company believes sales of its innovative and\ndifferentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can\nconvey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,\ndemonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on\nMacintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with\nthe Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a\nhigh-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting\nand retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its\nproducts in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has\nexpanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail\nstores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 165 stores open as of September\u00a030,\n2006.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company also staffs selected third-party stores\nwith the Company\u0092s own employees to improve the buying experience through\nreseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in\nreseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and\nAustralia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online\nstores around the world.\n\n\n\n\nTo improve access to the\niPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of\ndistribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can be\npurchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large\nretail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels\nlisted above.\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting\nPolicies and Estimates\n\n\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related\ndisclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\nand the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and\nresults of operations require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments,\nassumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements of this Form\u00a010-K describes the\nsignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the\nCompany\u0092s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be\nreasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for\nmaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual\nresults may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.\n\n\n\n\nManagement believes the\nCompany\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to\nrevenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and\ninventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, and\nincome taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they\nare both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and\nresults, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about\nmatters that are inherently uncertain. The Company\u0092s senior management has\nreviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the\nAudit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors.\n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\n\n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support\ncontracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting \n\n\n\n\n50\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstandards, including American Institute of Certified\nPublic Accountants Statement of Position (\u0093SOP\u0094) No.\u00a097-2, \n\nSoftware Revenue Recognition\n\n, as amended, and SEC Staff\nAccounting Bulletin (\u0093SAB\u0094) No.\u00a0104, \n\nRevenue Recognition.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive\nevidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is\nfixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered\ndelivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss\nhave been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,\nfor some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,\nthe Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the\nCompany retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If\nat the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is\nnot, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and\nsubsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other\ncriteria for revenue recognition have been met.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company records\nreductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and\nfor customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and\nother sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving\nprice protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to\nbe refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably\nestimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. If\nrefunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable\nestimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive\nprograms, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of\nthe date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the\nprogram is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected\nfuture product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future\nmarket conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase\ncustomer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations\nthat could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs\nare offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require\nmanagement to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the\nincentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions\nof particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of\ncustomers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record\nadditional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on\nthe Company\u0092s results of operations.\n\n\n\n\nAllowance for\nDoubtful Accounts\n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through\nthird-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,\nconsumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require\ncollateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in\ncertain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company\ndoes attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance\nfor certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by\narranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements\nand other loan and lease programs to the Company\u0092s direct customers. These\ncredit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing\ncompany and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume\nany recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.\nHowever, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,\nthird-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the\nCompany\u0092s distribution and retail channel partners.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nallowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u0092s \n\nassessment of\nthe collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of\nthe credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers.\n\n \n\nThe Company records an allowance to reduce\nthe specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be\ncollectible\n\n. The Company also records an\nallowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including \n\nhistorical\nexperience with bad debts, the general economic \n\n\n\n\n51\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenvironment, the financial\ncondition of the Company\u0092s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables.\n\n \n\nIf there is a deterioration of a major\ncustomer\u0092s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional\ninformation related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future\nactual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those\ncurrently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for\ndoubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments\nwere made.\n\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments\n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and\nbuild inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a\nwrite-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party\nproducts held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated\ndemand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of\ninventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand\nforecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales\nlevels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumer\nelectronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product\nand component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market\nconditions for the Company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if\nunforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component\ninventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which\nwould negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were\nrecorded.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company accrues\nreserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have\nbeen cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry\npractice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase\norders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand\ninformation. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s requirements for\nperiods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial\ndecline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products or an unanticipated\nchange in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, the\nCompany may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees\nthat would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation\nfees are identified.\n\n\n\n\nWarranty Costs\n\n\n\n\nThe Company provides currently for the estimated cost\nfor hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is\nrecognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical\nand projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that\nare outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company\nreevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty\nliabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to\nwarranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. \n\nIf actual product failure rates or repair costs\ndiffer from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be\nrequired and could \n\nnegatively affect the Company\u0092s results of\noperations.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company periodically\nprovides updates to its applications and system software to maintain the\nsoftware\u0092s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such\nupdates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time\nrelated software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining\nappropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units\ndelivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and\nestimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.\n\n\n\n\nStock-Based\nCompensation\n\n\n\n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in\naccordance with SFAS No.\u00a0123R. Under the provisions of SFAS No.\u00a0123R,\nstock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award\u0092s\nfair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (\u0093BSM\u0094) option-pricing\nmodel and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. The\nBSM model requires various highly \n\n\n\n\n52\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\njudgmental assumptions including volatility,\nforfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used in\nthe BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ\nmaterially in the future from that recorded in the current period.\n\n\n\n\nIn connection with the\nCompany\u0092s restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the Company has\napplied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prior\noption grants. Information regarding the restatement, including ranges of\npossible additional stock-based compensation expense if other measurement dates\nhad been selected for certain grants, is set forth in the \u0093Explanatory Note\u0094\nimmediately preceding Part\u00a0I, Item 1 and in Note 2, \u0093Restatement of\nConsolidated Financial Statements\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements of this Form\u00a010-K.\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n\n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the\nanticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In\naccordance with SFAS No.\u00a0109, \n\nAccounting for Income\nTaxes\n\n, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset\nand liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between\nthe financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for\noperating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to\ntaxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected\nto be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce\ndeferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be\nrealized.\n\n\n\n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that\nforecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of\ncertain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred\ntax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax\nassets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are\ndetermined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation\nallowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nSimilarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were\npreviously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance\nwould be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period\nsuch determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities\ninvolves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the\napplication of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner\ninconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the\nCompany\u0092s results of operations and financial position.\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Sales\n\n\n\n\nNet\nsales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit\nsales by product follow (net sales in

This increase was due in part to\nthe fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. Several other\nfactors contributed to these increases including the following:\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet sales of \n\niPods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006\ncompared to 2005. Unit sales of iPods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, which\nrepresents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million iPod units sold in 2005. Strong\niPod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both\n\n the hard-drive based iPod that supports video,\nfirst introduced in October\u00a0of 2005 and the iPod nano, introduced in September\u00a02005,\nas well as continued expansion of iPod distribution points. \n\nDuring 2006,\nthe net sales per iPod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily due\nto an overall decrease in average selling prices for all iPods as well as a\nshift in product mix to the iPod nano. From the introduction of the iPod in\n2002 through 2006, the Company has sold approximately 68 million iPods.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nMacintosh net sales\nincreased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh unit\nsales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005. \n\nThese increases were mainly due to strong demand\nfor the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro systems and reflect a shift in\nproduct mix to portable products in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. Net\nsales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s portable products increased 43% and 42%,\nrespectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh desktop net sales and\nunit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease in\nsales of the Company\u0092s Macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of the\nCompany\u0092s professional-oriented desktop products. The Company believes the\ndecline in the Company\u0092s professional-oriented desktop products was due to\ncustomers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release of\nthe Intel-based Mac Pro, which did not begin shipping until August\u00a02006,\nand updated software applications capable of running on Intel-based Macintosh\ncomputers, and the trend toward portable computers. A slight increase of 1%\nduring 2006 in net sales per Macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix to\nhigher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions on\ncertain Macintosh systems.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nOther\nmusic related products and services consists of sales associated with the\niTunes Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music\nrelated products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006\ncompared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased net sales from\nthe iTunes Store and Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and\nservices. The increase in sales from the iTunes Store stemmed from significant\ngrowth in U.S. sales and the opening of The iTunes Store in Japan during August\u00a02005\nand Australia during October\u00a02005. The increased sales from the iTunes\nStore were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows,\nand feature-length movie downloads.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet sales of software,\nservice, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to\n2005. The growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of \n\nAppleCare Protection Plan (\u0093APP\u0094) extended service\nand support contracts\n\n and application software, partially offset by a\ndecrease in sales of Mac OS X. \n\nMac OS X\nsales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April\u00a02005.\n\n\n\n\nOffsetting the\nfavorable factors discussed above, the Company\u0092s net sales during 2006 were\nnegatively impacted by the following:\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet sales of \n\nperipherals and other hardware declined $26 million\nor 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in net\nsales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. The\ndecrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overall\ndecrease in unit sales of Macintosh professional desktop systems.\n\n\n\n\n55\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year 2005 versus 2004\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2005, net\nsales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. Several factors contributed\nfavorably to net sales during 2005:\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet sales of \n\niPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared\nto 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented an\nincrease of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales of\niPods during 2005 were experienced in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments\nand was driven by \n\nstrong demand for the iPod\nshuffle introduced in January\u00a02005, the release of an updated version of\nthe iPod mini in February\u00a02005, the release of the iPod nano in September\u00a02005,\nand expansion of the iPod\u0092s distribution network\n\n. Net sales per iPod\nunit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced\niPod shuffle in January\u00a02005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February\u00a02005.\nFrom the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company had sold\napproximately 28 million iPods.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet\nsales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or\n223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company experienced strong growth in\nsales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall\niPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store were\nprimarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion in\nEurope, Canada, and Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nTotal\nMacintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004.\nUnit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005\ncompared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales related\nprimarily to strong demand for the Company\u0092s desktop products, which was\nexperienced in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. The Company believes\nthat the success of the iPod had a positive impact on Macintosh net sales by\nintroducing new customers to the Company\u0092s other products. Desktop demand was\nstimulated in 2005 due to the iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January\u00a02005.\nNet sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%,\nrespectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit sales\nalso included sales of the Company\u0092s portable products, which increased 11% and\n21%, respectively, compared to 2004.\n\n\n\n\nNet sales per Macintosh\nunit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was the result\nof changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer\nproducts, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop and\nportable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in\nthe proportion of direct sales.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet\nsales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to\n2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer\naccessories. \n\nNet sales \n\nof other\nhardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSight\ndigital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.\n\n\n\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nNet sales of software, service and other sales\nrose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth was\nprimarily attributable to increased net sales in APP extended service and\nsupport contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computer\nsales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .Mac\nInternet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software,\nand Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4\nTiger in April\u00a02005.\n\n\n\n\nSegment Operating\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\nThe Company manages its\nbusiness primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u0092s reportable operating\nsegments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The\nAmericas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities\nrelated to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and\nSouth America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the \n\n\n\n\n56\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiddle East and Africa.\nThe Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada,\nJapan, and the U.K. during 2006. Each reportable geographic operating segment\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further\ninformation regarding the Company\u0092s operating segments may be found in Note 11,\n\u0093Segment Information and Geographic Data\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements of this Form\u00a010-K.\n\n\n\n\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2006, net sales in the Americas segment\nincreased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. The main factors for this\nincrease were significant increases in net sales of iPods, other music related\nproducts and services, Macintosh portable systems, and APP. Sales of iPods\nincreased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with\nvideo-playing capabilities in October\u00a02005 and the iPod nano during September\u00a02005.\nThe increase in other music related products and services was due to increases\nin sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from the\niTunes Store. The increase in sales of Macintosh portable systems in the\nAmericas was due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro\nduring 2006. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a\ndecline in net sales of desktops, displays, and Mac OS X. The decrease in\ndesktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in product\nmix toward portable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales decreased from 2005 since\nthe Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began\nshipping in April\u00a02005. During 2006, the Americas segment represented\napproximately 48% of the Company\u0092s total net sales as compared to 47% in the\nsame period of 2005. During 2006, U.S. education channel net sales and\nMacintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005.\nNet sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to\n2005 due to strong sales of Macintosh portable products and iPods. Net sales\nwere relatively flat for K-12 due to continued budget constraints.\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2005, net sales in\nthe Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase in\nnet sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant\nyear-over-year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related products\nand services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. This\nincrease was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which\nhad 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unit\nsales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by\nstrong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the\nupdated iMac, which began shipping in September\u00a02004, and the Mac mini,\nwhich was introduced in January\u00a02005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americas\nsegment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Company\u0092s\ntotal net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of\ntotal Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in both U.S.\neducation channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004.\nStrength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac and\nportable system shipments. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net\nsales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challenges\nin the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive\npressures, the Company\u0092s K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during\n2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales.\n\n\n\n\nEurope\n\n\n\n\nEurope segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33%\nduring 2006 compared to 2005. Consistent with the Americas segment, these\nincreases were a result of strong growth in iPod sales, other music related\nproducts and services, and Macintosh portable systems. Sales of iPods increased\nprimarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playing\ncapabilities in October\u00a02005 and the iPod nano during September\u00a02005.\nThe increase in other music related products and services was due to increases\nin sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from the\niTunes Store. The increase in sales of portable systems in Europe was due to\nstrong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro that were introduced\nduring 2006. In addition, Europe also reported increased sales in APP related\nto the increase in Macintosh unit sales. These increases were partially offset\nby a decrease in desktop and \n\n\n\n\n57\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMac\u00a0OS\u00a0X net sales during 2006 compared to\n2005. The decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix toward\nportable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since the\nCompany has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shipping\nin April\u00a02005.\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2005, net sales in\nthe Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unit\nsales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing\n47% in 2005 compared to 2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe\nexperienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music related\nproducts and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during\n2005 was particularly strong for the Company\u0092s desktop computers, which\nexperienced a year-over-year increase of 56% from 2004. Similar to the results\nof the Company\u0092s other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software\nwere strong in 2005.\n\n\n\n\nJapan\n\n\n\n\nJapan\u0092s net sales increased $288 million or 31% during\n2006 compared to 2005. The Japan segment experienced increased net sales in\niPods, \n\nMacintosh portable products,\n\n\nand other music related products and services. Consistent with the Company\u0092s\nother segments, Japan experienced increases in sales of iPods due to the\nintroduction of the iPod with video-playing capabilities and the iPod nano in October\u00a0and\nSeptember\u00a0of 2005, respectively. Japan also experienced strong sales of\nthe Intel-based MacBook and increased sales from the iTunes Store. These\nincreases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Macintosh desktop\nproducts, displays, and Mac OS X. The decreases in desktop products and\ndisplays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable Macintosh\nsystems. \n\nMac OS X sales have decreased from\n2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger\nbegan shipping in April\u00a02005. \n\nTotal Macintosh unit sales during\n2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. The relatively flat growth in\nMacintosh unit sales is partially attributable to Japan\u0092s overall slow consumer\nPC market growth. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve its\nindirect and direct channel sales in Japan.\n\n\n\n\nJapan\u0092s net sales and\nMacintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to\n2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, and\nother music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit sales\nincreased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during\n2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset\nby a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which\nthe Company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales from\nportables to the iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as a\nresult of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005.\n\n\n\n\nRetail\n\n\n\n\nThe Company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006,\nincluding a total of 10 international stores in the U.K., Japan, and Canada,\nbringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of September\u00a030, 2006. This\ncompares to 124 open stores as of September\u00a024, 2005 and 86 open stores as\nof September\u00a025, 2004.\n\n\n\n\nThe Retail segment\u0092s net sales increased by 43% to\n$3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment Macintosh unit sales\nincreased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005.\n\n\nWith an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per store\nincreased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6\nmillion in 2004. The current year increase \n\nwas primarily due to strong\nsales of Macintosh portable and desktop products, iPods, and other music\nrelated products and services. \n\nSales of\niPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with\nvideo-playing capabilities in October\u00a02005 and the iPod nano during September\u00a02005.\nThe increase in other music related products and services was due to increased\nsales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories. Macintosh portable and\ndesktop sales increased due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook, MacBook\nPro, and iMac.\n\n\n\n\nAs measured by the Company\u0092s operating segment\nreporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during\n2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and \n\n\n\n\n58\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noperating income of $39 million during 2004. This\nimprovement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores and\nthe segment\u0092s year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, which\nresulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs.\n\n\n\n\nExpansion of the Retail\nsegment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in\nfixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments,\npersonnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with\nthe Retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capital\nexpenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $729\nmillion. As of September\u00a030, 2006, the Retail segment had approximately\n5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with\nretail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. The\nCompany would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores.\nSuch costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\n\n\n\nGross Margin\n\n\n\n\nGross\nmargin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions,\nexcept gross margin percentages):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a030,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a024,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a025,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00a0Restated\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00a0Restated\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19,315\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,931\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8,279\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13,717\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9,889\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6,022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5,598\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4,042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2,257\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross margin percentage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n29.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n27.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nSee the \u0093Explanatory\nNote\u0094 immediately preceding Part\u00a0I, Item 1 and Note 2, \u0093Restatement of\nConsolidated Financial Statements\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements of this Form\u00a010-K.\n\n\n\n\nGross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flat\nas compared to 2005. The Company experienced more favorable pricing on certain\ncommodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory and\nhigher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production\ncosts, offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales and other music-related\nservices.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company anticipates that its gross margin and the\ngross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries will\nbe under pressure due to price competition. The Company expects gross margin\npercentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as a\nresult of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as\nthe iPod and content from the iTunes Store.\n\n\n\n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s\nexpected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. There can be no assurance\nthat current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted gross\nmargin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and\nmargins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry\nwide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life\ncycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and\noutside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company\u0092s product\nmix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average\nselling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these competitive\npressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with\nrespect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s\nability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to\nstimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant\ninternational operations, financial results can be significantly affected in\nthe short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and\nbuilds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company\u0092s markets\nare volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a \n\n\n\n\n59\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrisk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce\nor order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular\nproducts or components. The Company\u0092s operating results and financial condition\nin the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by\nthe Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase\ncommitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand\npatterns.\n\n\n\n\nGross margin percentage\nincreased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. The\nCompany\u0092s gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on\ncertain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory;\nan increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales\nrelated primarily to the Company\u0092s retail and online stores; and higher overall\nrevenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. These\nincreases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin\niPod sales.\n\n\n\n\nOperating Expenses\n\n\n\n\nOperating\nexpenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions,\nexcept for percentages):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a030,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a024,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a025,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00a0Restated\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs\u00a0Restated\u00a0(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch and\n  development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n712\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n535\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n491\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelling, general,\n  and administrative expenses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2,433\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,864\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1,430\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring costs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nSee\nthe \u0093Explanatory Note\u0094 immediately preceding Part\u00a0I, Item 1 and Note 2, \u0093Restatement\nof Consolidated Financial Statements,\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements of this Form\u00a010-K.\n\n\n\n\nResearch and\nDevelopment (R&D)\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures for R&D\nincreased 33% or $177 million to $712 million in 2006 compared to $535 million\nin 2005. The increase was due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in\nthe current year to support expanded R&D activities, an increase of $46\nmillion in stock-based compensation recognized as R&D expense resulting\nfrom the adoption of SFAS No.\u00a0123R, and higher overall expenses due to \n\nthe 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of\n2006\n\n to realign the Company\u0092s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters\n\n. \n\nIn addition, during 2005, the Company\ncapitalized approximately $29.7 million of costs associated with the\ndevelopment of Mac OS X Tiger. No software development costs were capitalized\nduring 2006. Further information related to the Company\u0092s capitalization of\nsoftware development costs may be found in Part\u00a0II, Item 8 of this Form\u00a010-K\nat Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite the increase\nin expenditures, R&D as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat\nin 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the significant increase in revenue. The\nCompany continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical\nto its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are\ndirectly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are\ncentral to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects\nto make further investments in R&D to remain competitive.\n\n\n\n\nSelling, General,\nand Administrative Expense (SG&A)\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures for SG&A increased $569 million or\n31% during 2006 compared to 2005. These increases are due primarily to the\nCompany\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and\ninternational markets, an increase of $50 million in stock-based compensation\nexpense recognized as \n\n\n\n\n60\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSG&A expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No.\u00a0123R,\na current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising,\nhigher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net\nsales and employee salary merit increases, and \n\nthe expenses associated with the 14th week added to the first fiscal\nquarter of 2006\n\n. Despite the increase in expenditures, SG&A as a\npercentage of total net sales in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005.\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures for SG&A\nincreased $434 million or 30% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases are\ndue primarily to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment in\nboth domestic and international markets, a current year increase in\ndiscretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and\nchannel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee\nsalary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was\n13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of\n68% for the Company during 2005.\n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2004 Restructuring\nActions\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2004, the Company\nrecorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, including\napproximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset\nimpairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellations\nrelate to vacating a leased sales facility as a result of a European workforce\nreduction during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had been\nutilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million for\nlease cancellations. These actions resulted in the termination of 452\npositions.\n\n\n\n\nOther Income and\nExpense\n\n\n\n\nOther\nincome and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in\nmillions):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a030,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a024,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember\u00a025,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2005\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGains on\n  non-current investments, net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest income\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n394\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n183\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther income\n  (expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest and\n  other income, net\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n365\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n165\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal other\n  income and expense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n365\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n165\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nGains and Losses on\nNon-current Investments\n\n\n\n\nThe Company previously\nheld significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), \n\nAkamai Technologies,\u00a0Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network,\u00a0Inc.\n(EarthLink). T\n\nhe Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these\nnon-current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale\nof these non-current investments were $4 million in 2004.\n\n\n\n\nInterest and Other\nIncome, Net\n\n\n\n\nTotal interest and other income, net increased $200\nmillion or 121% to $365\u00a0million during 2006 compared to $165 million in\n2005 and $53 million in 2004. These increases are attributable primarily to\nhigher cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yields\nresulting from higher market interest rates and \n\nthe 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006\n\n. The\nweighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared to\nthe 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. The\ncurrent year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreign\ncurrency hedging expenses.\n\n\n\n\nInterest expense in 2004\nconsisted primarily of interest on the Company\u0092s $300\u00a0million aggregate\nprincipal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February\u00a02004.\nThe unsecured notes \n\n\n\n\n61\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwere sold at 99.925% of\npar for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting\nfrom the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized\nas of the notes\u0092 maturity in February\u00a02004.\n\n\n\n\nProvision for\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rate for the year ended September\u00a030,\n2006 was approximately 29%. The Company\u0092s effective rate differs from the\nstatutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed\nforeign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are\nintended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In addition, the\nCompany recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior year\ntax audits in the U.S., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from the\ndividend repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (\u0093AJCA\u0094) and\ninternational tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation as\nfurther discussed below.\n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a030, 2006, the Company had\ndeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses,\nand tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferred\nliabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company\u0092s balance\nsheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning\nstrategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will\nbe sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. As of September\u00a030,\n2006 and September\u00a024, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million was\nrecorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operating\nlosses that may not be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate the\nrealizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for\nand amount of the valuation allowance.\n\n\n\n\nOn October\u00a022, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law.\nThe AJCA included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign\nearnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA, within a specified time\nframe. Among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deduction\nmust be reinvested in the United States in certain qualified investments\npursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the CEO and Board of\nDirectors. During 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion of\nforeign earnings. Of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for the\nreduced tax rate provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a tax\ncharge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under the\nprovisions of the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71\u00a0million\nresulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognize\ndeferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certain\nforeign subsidiaries.\n\n\n\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (\u0093IRS\u0094) has substantially\ncompleted its field audit of the Company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the\nyears 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intends\nto contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially\nall IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition,\nthe Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management\nbelieves that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may\nresult from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be\npredicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax\naudits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations,\nthe Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the\nperiod such resolution occurs.\n\n\n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterly Financial\nInformation\n\n\n\n\nThe\nfollowing tables set forth a summary of the Company\u0092s

end of\n2005. The principal \n\n\n\n\n67\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomponents of this\nincrease were cash generated by operating activities of $2.22 billion, proceeds\nof $318 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, and excess\ntax benefits from stock-based compensation of $361 million, partially offset by\ncash used to purchase property, plant, and equipment of $657 million and\nrepurchases of common stock of $355 million in conjunction with net-share\nsettlements on vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. Cash\ngenerated from operating activities includes the impact of the $1.25 billion\nprepayment for NAND flash memory components. The Company\u0092s short-term\ninvestment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid\ninvestments. As of September\u00a030, 2006, approximately $4.1 billion of the\nCompany\u0092s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by\nforeign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated\nholdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S.\nincome taxation on repatriation to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes its\nexisting balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\nwill be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures,\nstock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity\nrequirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.\n\n\n\n\nCapital\nExpenditures\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s total\ncapital expenditures were $657 million during 2006, consisting of $200 million\nfor retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company\u0092s Retail\nsegment, $263 million for real estate acquisitions \n\nfor the Company\u0092s second corporate campus and for a new data center\n\n,\nand $194 million for corporate infrastructure, including information systems\nenhancements. \n\nThe Company currently\nanticipates it will utilize approximately $675 million for capital expenditures\nduring 2007, including approximately $360 million for expansion of the Company\u0092s\nRetail segment, approximately $50 million for real estate acquisitions\nincluding the Company\u0092s second corporate campus and its new data center, and\napproximately $265 million to support normal replacement of existing capital\nassets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nStock Repurchase\nPlan\n\n\n\n\nIn July\u00a01999, the\nCompany\u0092s Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up\nto $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the\nCompany to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any\nspecified period of time. The Company has repurchased a total of 13.1 million\nshares at a cost of $217 million under this plan and was authorized to\nrepurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September\u00a030,\n2006.\n\n\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet\nArrangements and Contractual Obligations\n\n\n\n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with\nunconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees,\nsubordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent\narrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent\nliabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an\nunconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or\ncredit risk support to the Company.\n\n\n\n\nThe\nfollowing table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual\nobligations with minimum firm commitments as of September\u00a030, 2006 and\nexcludes amounts

billion, $887 million of which related to the\nlease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Company\u0092s existing\nmajor facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years.\n\n\n\n\nPurchase\nCommitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers\n\n\n\n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to\nmanufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s products and to perform final\nassembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire\ncomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by the\nCompany, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The\nCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety\nof individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company\nacquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\ncontracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase\ncommitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and\nmanufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September\u00a030,\n2006, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component\npurchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\nDuring 2006, the Company\nentered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor,\u00a0Inc.,\nIntel Corporation, Micron Technology,\u00a0Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,\nand Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar\nyear 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion for\nflash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied to\ninventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.\n\n\n\n\nAsset Retirement\nObligations\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s asset\nretirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property\nsubject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of\nSeptember\u00a030, 2006, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash\nflows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill these\nobligations.\n\n\n\n\nOther Obligations\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s other\nobligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to Internet and\ntelecommunications services.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnifications\n\n\n\n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of\nits operating system and application software against legal claims that the\nsoftware infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements\nentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under\nwhich the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an\ninfringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,\nthe Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting\nfrom such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified\nthird-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability\nrelated to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would\nhave a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results\nof operations.\n\n\n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate and\nForeign Currency Risk Management\n\n\n\n\nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rate\nswap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction\nwith its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures.\nHowever, given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management\nactivities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no\nassurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact\nresulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In\naddition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses\nrelated to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not\ncoincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic\nexposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s operating results\nand financial position.\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate\nfluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the\nCompany\u0092s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the\ngeneral level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest\nrates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents, and\nshort-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency\nhedges.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s short-term investment policy and\nstrategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements,\nand optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rate\nenvironment. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers\nwithin the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to an objective\nmarket benchmark. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against\nexternal manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to market risk for changes in\ninterest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio. The\nCompany places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued by\nhigh credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit\nexposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s general policy is to limit the risk of\nprincipal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and\ncredit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three\nmonths or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investments\nwith initial maturities greater than three months are classified as short-term\ninvestments. As of September\u00a030, 2006, approximately $921 million of the\nCompany\u0092s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5\nyears. As of September\u00a024, 2005, $287 million of the Company\u0092s short-term\ninvestments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainder\nall had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its\ninvestments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation\nof credit deterioration or for duration management. The Company recognized net\nlosses before taxes of $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively,\nand a net gain before taxes of $1 million in 2004 as a result of such sales.\n\n\n\n\nTo provide a meaningful\nassessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment\nportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact\na change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio\nassuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on\ninvestment positions as of September\u00a030, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basis\npoint increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $15.2\nmillion decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September\u00a024,\n2005, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in\na $19.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized if\nthe Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\n\n\n\n70\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Currency\nRisk\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of foreign\ncurrencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales\nand gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk the\nCompany will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive\npressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and\noption contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign\nexchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly\ncommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in\nforeign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority\nof its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the\nCompany may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due to\nimmateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and\nlimited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.\n\n\n\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign\ncurrency risk associated with certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency\nderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a\nvalue-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in\nexchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to\ngenerate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss\nin fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign\nexchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not\nintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and\nmanagement tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted\ntransactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in\nforeign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the\nmodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair\nvalue of $9.2 million as of September\u00a030, 2006 compared to a maximum\none-day loss of $10.0 million as of September\u00a024, 2005. Because the\nCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred\non those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the\nunderlying exposures.\n\n\n\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the\nCompany\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially\nfrom the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a030, 2006 due to\nthe inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing\nand amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company\u0092s\nactual exposures and positions.\n\n\n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors \n\n \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n \n\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in\u00a0response to\ntighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on the demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand could also differ materially from the Company\u0092s\nexpectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to offset the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a trend which has been very pronounced recently. Other factors that could influence\ndemand include continuing increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer\nspending behavior. These and other economic factors could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services and on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of\nbusiness have resulted in a tightening in the credit\u00a0markets, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. There\u00a0could be a number of follow-on\neffects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the\nCompany\u0092s products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Company\u0092s treasury operations. Other income and\u00a0expense\ncould also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrelated to debt\u00a0securities as well as equity and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative\ninstruments.\u00a0The current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments could differ\nsignificantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n \n\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase\nthe volatility of the Company\u0092s stock price. \n\n \n\nThe matters relating to the Company\u0092s past stock option practices and the restatement of the\nCompany\u0092s consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation. \n\n \n\nThe findings from the Company\u0092s investigation into its past\nstock option granting practices and the resulting restatement of prior financial statements in the Company\u0092s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year September\u00a030, 2006 (the \u00932006 Form 10-K\u0094) have exposed the Company to\ngreater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. As described in Part I, Item\u00a03, \u0093Legal Proceedings,\u0094 several derivative complaints and a class action complaint have been filed in\nstate and federal courts against the Company and certain current and former directors and executive officers pertaining to allegations relating to past stock option grants. The Company has provided the results of its investigation to the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the \u0093SEC\u0094) and the United States Attorney\u0092s Office for the Northern District of California, and the Company has responded to their requests for documents and additional information. The Company intends to\ncontinue to provide its full cooperation. \n\n \n\nOn April\u00a024, 2007, the SEC filed an enforcement action against two former officers of the Company. In\nannouncing the lawsuit, the SEC stated that it would not bring an enforcement action against the Company based in part on the Company\u0092s \u0093swift, extensive, and extraordinary cooperation in the Commission\u0092s investigation.\u0094\nAccording to the SEC\u0092s statement, the Company\u0092s \u0093cooperation consisted of, among other things, prompt self-reporting, an independent internal investigation, the sharing of the results of that investigation with the government, and the\nimplementation of new controls designed to prevent the recurrence of fraudulent conduct.\u0094 The enforcement actions against each of these former officers have now been settled. \n\n \n\nNo assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from litigation relating to the Company\u0092s past stock option practices. These and related matters have required, and will continue to require, the Company to incur\nsubstantial expenses for legal, accounting, tax, and other professional services, and may divert management\u0092s attention from the Company\u0092s business. If the Company is subject to adverse findings, it could be required to pay damages and\npenalties and might face additional remedies that could harm its financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nGlobal markets for personal computers,\ndigital music devices, mobile communication devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company competes in global markets that are highly competitive and characterized by\naggressive price cutting, with its resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid\nadoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete\nsuccessfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of new innovative products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution\nfor its personal computers, consumer electronics, and mobile communication devices, including the hardware, operating system, several software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research\nand development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of the Company\u0092s\ncompetitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and have a\nmaterially adverse affect on its financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a\nsignificant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has\nbeen particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB, education,\nenterprise, government, and creative markets. An increasing number of Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u0092s existing\nproducts. \n\n \n\nThe Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer\nmarket, which is dominated by makers of computers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve the Mac\nplatform to maintain design and functional advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies\u0092 hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company\u0092s hardware products, and could materially adversely affect\nthe Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices, such as iPhone;\nconsumer electronic devices, including the iPod family of digital music players, and digital content distribution. The Company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution, and other\nresources, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. The Company has only recently entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have\nsignificantly greater experience, product breadth, and distribution channels than the Company. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain digital content. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and\nexperience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach\nto providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\n \n\nThere can be no assurance\nthe Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand,\nthe Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal\ncomputer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success\nof new product introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the\navailability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues\nnecessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nIf the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its inventory, asset, and related provisions are currently adequate, no\nassurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, consumer electronics, and mobile communication industries, the Company will not incur additional inventory or asset related\ncharges. Such charges have had, and could have, a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company must\norder components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open\norders based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and\nprice changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be\nin the future materially adversely affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\n \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient\nquantities. \n\n \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs,\ncertain optical drives, and ASICs, from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including, but not limited to NAND\nflash memory, DRAM and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including, but not limited to\nmicroprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable\npricing in the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that can have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience\ndecreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new and innovative products that have higher\ncost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, and higher logistical costs. For additional information refer to Part II, Item\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093Gross Margin,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n \n\nThe Company and other participants\nin the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not\ncommon to the rest of the personal computer, consumer electronics or mobile communication industries. The Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a\nneed for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured. Continued availability of these components at\nacceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. If the supply of a key single-sourced component\nfor a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical\nservices provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nMost of the Company\u0092s components and products are manufactured in\nwhole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and are geographically concentrated \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs,\nthey also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to\nchanging conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company\u0092s supplier code of conduct. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the\nCompany may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nFinal assembly of the Company\u0092s products is\ncurrently performed in the Company\u0092s manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, Korea, China and the Czech Republic. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced\nthird-party vendors in the U.S., China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u0092s portable products, including\nMacBook Pro, MacBook, MacBook Air, iPods, iPhones and most of the Company\u0092s iMacs. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military\nactions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the Company\u0092s iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the\nrights to audio and video content. The Company\u0092s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content\nproviders currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\nseek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic\nreach, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nMany third-party content providers require that\nthe Company provide certain digital rights management (\u0093DRM\u0094) and other security solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the\nCompany will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the\nprotection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the Company\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on\naccess to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the Company\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to seek or renew licenses relating\nto various aspects of its products and business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary\nlicenses would be available on acceptable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nBecause of technological changes in the global personal computer, consumer electronics and\nmobile communication industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company\u0092s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other\nintellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpense. At present, the Company is vigorously defending more than 21 patent infringement cases, 13 of which were filed during fiscal 2008, and several\npending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that\nlitigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a\nsuccessful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop\nnon-infringing technology. While in management\u0092s opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail\nin any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nWith the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company has begun to compete with mobile\ncommunication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.\u00a0Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0the merits of any\u00a0potential patent claims by competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted\nlitigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/or\u00a0modify its products. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed\nand maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by\ncustomers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPods and iPhones, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will\ncontinue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company\u0092s products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and\nservices depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based\non factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the\nCompany\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s products and more inclined to\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. The Company\u0092s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as\nMicrosoft, Adobe, and Google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the Company\u0092s products. Mac OS X Leopard, which became available in October 2007, includes a new feature that enables Intel-based\nMac systems to run Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. This feature may deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such applications are already available for the Windows platform. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iPhone and iPod touch, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. As with\napplications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather\nthan its competitors\u0092, including devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s devices may suffer. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased\nsales and operating margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in design and\nmanufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. Defects may also occur in\ncomponents and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm\nto reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products.\nGross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s\ndirect sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially\nadversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared\nto the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than\nit does during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s key logistics, components\nsupply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn certain\ncountries, including the U.S., the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone. \n\n \n\nIn the U.S., U.K., France,\nGermany, Spain, Ireland, and certain other countries, the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers\nin their markets for any reason, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions of end-user\ncontracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices. \n\n \n\nLaws and regulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes,\nwhich\u00a0could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier\u0092s network,\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nMobile communication devices, such as iPhone, are\nsubject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in\nadditional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data\nsecurity. \n\n \n\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company\u0092s operations by\ncausing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company\u0092s online offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial\nresults, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company\u0092s reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal\ncontrol measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price continues to be volatile. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, or uncertainty about current global economic\nconditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance.\nFurthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline. \n\n \n\nPolitical events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international\ncommerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to\ninterruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make\nit difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major\npublic health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between\nregions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate\nheadquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for\ndirect quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its CEO, its executive team and key employees in technical, marketing and staff positions.\nExperienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key employees are located. The Company has relied on equity awards\nas one means for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options have resulted in increased stock-based compensation expense, which has caused the Company to reduce the number of\nstock-based awards issued to employees and could negatively impact the Company\u0092s ability to attract and retain key personnel. Additionally, significant adverse volatility in the Company\u0092s stock price could result in a stock option\u0092s\nexercise price exceeding the underlying stock\u0092s market value or a significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units (\u0093RSUs\u0094) granted, thus lessening the \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffectiveness of retaining employees through stock-based awards. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain\nkey personnel. \n\n \n\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims\nmay arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of its merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of\nmanagement attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material settlements. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same\nreporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company derives a large and growing portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. As a result, its financial condition and operating results\ncould be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar\nversus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in\nforeign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia, as well as non-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand\nfor the Company\u0092s products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S.\ndollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the\nCompany to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. As strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies. \n\n \n\nThe Company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and\nuncertainties. \n\n \n\nThrough September\u00a027, 2008, the Company had opened 247 retail stores. The Company\u0092s retail stores have required substantial\nfixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority\nof which are for 10 years. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations\nand size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of\nindividual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n22 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and\nuncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the Retail segment\u0092s future results, cause its actual results to differ from anticipated results and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store\nconstruction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs\nassociated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\n \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties,\nincluding distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u0092s due\ndiligence. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers, and other resellers. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute\nproducts from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end-users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online and retail\nstores. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. \n\n \n\nMany\nresellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as\ndistributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those\nproducts. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company\u0092s products, or if uncertainty\nregarding demand for the Company\u0092s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u0092s products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing\nselected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. \n\n \n\nAlthough the Company has not recognized any material losses on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, future declines in their market values could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has investments both domestically and internationally. Additionally, the Company\u0092s overall investment\nportfolio is often concentrated in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by the recent market liquidity conditions. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or\nlosses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments could decline and result in a material impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply\nagreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nA substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from the sale by the Company of components to vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the\nCompany. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND flash memory. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade\nreceivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may\nrequire the Company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several\njurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe and Asia, certain Canadian provinces and certain states within the U.S. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature\nof its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nChanges in the Company\u0092s tax rates could affect its future results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or\ntheir interpretation. The Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance. \n\n \n\nFor certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability.\u00a0Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable\nrisks, and in some cases self-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n ",

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the\nCompany\u0092s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled \u0093Risk\nFactors\u0094 above, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented\nherein is based on the Company\u0092s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n \n\nExecutive Overview\n\n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety\nof related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company\u0092s products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve, a\nportfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide\nthrough its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including\napplication software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (\u0093SMB\u0094), education,\nenterprise, government, and creative markets. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government\nand creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer,\nincluding the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and\nenjoying digital content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company\u0092s emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial\ndesigns. \n\n \n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer\nelectronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer\nand consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased\ninvestment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company\u0092s R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of\npersonal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes\nincreased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes a variety of direct\nand indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate\nthe unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support\nexperience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution\ncapabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 247 stores open as of September\u00a027, 2008. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nhas also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its\ntargeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors.\u00a0The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its\ndirect sales force. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased\nin certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. \n\n \n\niPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network\ncarriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhone 3G in over 70 countries. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and\ncertain other countries. The Company expects to ship iPhone 3G in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008. \n\n \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and\nEstimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the\nCompany\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u0094 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience\nand on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and\nsuch differences may be material. \n\n \n\nManagement believes the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue\nrecognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because\nthey are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has\nreviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content,\nperipherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in\nEmerging Issues Task Force (\u0093EITF\u0094) No.\u00a003-5, \n\nApplicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software\n\n, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable\ndigital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\u0093AICPA\u0094) Statement of Position (\u0093SOP\u0094) No.\u00a097-2, \n\nSoftware Revenue Recognition\n\n, as amended. For products that are not\nsoftware or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u0093SEC\u0094) Staff\nAccounting Bulletin (\u0093SAB\u0094) No.\u00a0104, \n\nRevenue Recognition. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement\nexists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the\nCompany\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer\nreceives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,\nrevenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. \n\n \n\nFor both\nApple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under\nsubscription accounting in accordance with SOP No.\u00a097-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss\nrecognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred. \n\n \n\nThe Company records\nreductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price\nprotection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u0092s policy\nrequires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later\nof the date at \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwhich the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future\nproduct returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result\nin additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience\nand the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative\nimpact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its\ncustomers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin\nAmerica, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company\u0092s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly\nbetween the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by\ncollateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company\u0092s distribution and retail channel partners. \n\n \n\nThe\nallowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u0092s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records\nan allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad\ndebts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company\u0092s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer\u0092s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware\nof additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful\naccounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. \n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and\nproducts, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple\nfactors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and\nunpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the\nutility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components\nthrough a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and\nsubstantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation\nfees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nWarranty Costs \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific\nproduct failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products\nsubject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.\u00a097-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.\u00a0If actual product failure rates or\nrepair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software\u0092s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for\nas warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur,\nand the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. \n\n \n\nStock-Based Compensation \n\n \n\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\u0093SFAS\u0094) No.\u00a0123 (revised 2004),\n\n\nShare-Based Payment\n\n. Under the provisions of SFAS No.\u00a0123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award\u0092s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (\u0093BSM\u0094) option-pricing\nmodel and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life.\nSignificant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future. \n\n \n\n \n\nIncome\nTaxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS\nNo.\u00a0109, \n\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n\n, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable\nincome in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at\nthe beginning of 2008, the Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. (\u0093FIN\u0094) 48, \n\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\u0097an interpretation of FASB Statement No.\u00a0109\n\n. Further information may be found in Note 5,\n\u0093Income Taxes\u0094 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that\nforecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the\nevent that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.\nIn addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with\nmanagement\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nLegal and Other\nContingencies \n\n \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Note 8 \u0093Commitments and\nContingencies\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No.\u00a05, \n\nAccounting for Contingencies\n\n,\nthe Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be\nreasonably estimated. In management\u0092s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these\nlegal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nNet Sales \n\n \n\nFiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. An additional week is\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. \n\n \n\nThe following table summarizes net\nsales and Mac

increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7\u00a0million units or 38%. Net sales related to the\nCompany\u0092s Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Company\u0092s total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Company\u0092s portable products as well as the\npopularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Company\u0092s reportable segments. Unit sales of the Company\u0092s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company\u0092s personal computer\nshipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the\nMacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Company\u0092s portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Company\u0092s desktop\nsystems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was\ndue to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift\nin overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. During 2008, sales of iPhone\nexpanded beyond the U.S. and the Company expects to be shipping iPhones in over 70 countries by the end of December 2008. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal\nquarter. iPhone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product\u0092s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier\nagreements. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net\nsales from the iTunes Store in each of the Company\u0092s geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video\ncontent available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $399 million or 32% compared to 2007 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware\naccessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was due in large part to increased sales of\nApple-branded and third-party developers\u0092 software products and increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (\u0093APP\u0094) extended service and support contracts. \n\n \n\nFiscal Year 2007 versus 2006 \n\n \n\nNet sales during 2007 increased\n24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75\u00a0million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales\ngrowth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company\u0092s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company\u0092s personal computer\nshipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each\nof the Company\u0092s operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac\nin each of the Company\u0092s operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was driven\nprimarily by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling\nprices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in\naccordance with subscription accounting over the product\u0092s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39\u00a0million in 2007.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store.\nThe Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware\naccessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006.

The Company\u0092s reportable operating\nsegments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment\nincludes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets.

The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch, Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store,\nand iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961\u00a0million or 32% is\nattributable to growth in all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded\nin June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Company\u0092s total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007. During 2008, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales increased by 14% and 19%, respectively,\ncompared to 2007. Net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 12% during the same period. \n\n \n\nDuring 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the\niTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to\na shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the\nintroduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company\u0092s total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales\nincreased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period. \n\n \n\nEurope \n\n \n\nFor 2008, net sales and unit sales in Europe increased 40%\nand 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were\nhigher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as the MacBook Air, introduced in January\n2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. Sales from the iTunes Store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital\ncontent and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007. \n\n \n\nEurope segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac\nportable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product\nmix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due primarily to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the\ngrowth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. \n\n \n\nJapan \n\n \n\nJapan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared\nto 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008\ncompared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly\nMacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nJapan\u0092s net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined\n1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment\u0092s overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the\niTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan\u0092s declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways\nto improve the future results of its Japan segment. \n\n \n\nRetail \n\n \n\nRetail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of Mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail\nstores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September\u00a027, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September\u00a029, 2007 and 165 open stores as of\nSeptember\u00a030, 2006. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007. \n\n \n\nRetail Mac net sales and Mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, iMac, and MacBook\nAir, introduced in January 2008. Net sales of iPods increased due to the popularity of the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. The higher iPod average selling price was due to strong\ndemand for the iPod touch. \n\n \n\nThe Retail segment\u0092s net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales\nincreased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. The increase in Retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was\ndue primarily to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products\nthrough third-party resellers. \n\n \n\nAs measured by the Company\u0092s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion\nduring 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007. \n\n\n\n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease\ncommitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.4 billion. As of\nSeptember\u00a027, 2008, the Retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur\nsubstantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nOther Segments \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in\nnet sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems, iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Company\u0092s Asia Pacific\nregion. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Company\u0092s Asia Pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the iMac and all Mac portables. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58%\nincrease in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company\u0092s Asia Pacific region. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nGross Margin \n\n \n\nGross\nmargin for the three fiscal years ended September\u00a027, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a032,479\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a024,006\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a019,315\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21,334\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15,852\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13,717\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n11,145\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n8,154\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,598\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin percentage\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n34.3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n34.0%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n29.0%\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007\nincreased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed\nproduction costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company\u0092s direct sales channels. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its gross margin percentage to\ndecrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on\nnew and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs. \n\n \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of\nthose set forth below in Part I, Item\u00a01A, \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 under the subheading \u0093\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash\nmemory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities\n\n,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and\nmargins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and\nexpected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (\u0093DRAM\u0094) and liquid crystal displays (\u0093LCDs\u0094), as well as potential increases in the\ncosts of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing\nactions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the\nCompany\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September\u00a027, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except for\npercentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,109\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n782\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n712\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general, and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,761\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,963\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,433\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.6%\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development (\u0093R&D\u0094) \n\n \n\nExpenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in\nthe current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses.

Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. The Company continues to\nbelieve that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core\nbusiness strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive. \n\n \n\nExpenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70\nmillion to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increases in R&D expense were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in 2007 to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first\nquarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above. \n\n \n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense (\u0093SG&A\u0094)\n\n\n \n\nExpenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher\nstock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international\nmarkets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007. \n\n \n\nExpenditures for SG&A increased\n$530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company\u0092s\ncontinued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007. \n\n \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\n \n\nOther income and expense for the three\nfiscal years ended September\u00a027, 2008, are as follows (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2006\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0653\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0647\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0394\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(33\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(48\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(29\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income and expense\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n620\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n365\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income and expense increased $21 million to $620\u00a0million during 2008 as compared to $599 million\nand $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average\ninterest rate earned of 3.44%. The overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the Company\u0092s higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to\n2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no debt outstanding and\naccordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\n \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended September\u00a027, 2008 and September\u00a029, 2007, and 29% for the year ended September\u00a030, 2006. The Company\u0092s effective rates differ\nfrom the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a027, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being\noffset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the Company\u0092s balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincome that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be\nsufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company\nwill continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. \n\n \n\nThe Internal\nRevenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the\nIRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s\nexpectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n \n\nRecent Accounting\nPronouncements \n\n \n\nIn September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u0093FASB\u0094) issued SFAS No.\u00a0157, \n\nFair Value Measurements,\n\n\nwhich defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No.\u00a0157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not\nrequire any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (\u0093FSP\u0094) No. FAS 157-1, \n\nApplication of FASB Statement No.\u00a0157 to FASB Statement No.\u00a013 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That\nAddress Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 \n\nand FSP No. FAS 157-2\n\n, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.\u00a0157\n\n. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No.\u00a0157 to remove certain leasing\ntransactions from its scope. FSP\u00a0157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS\u00a0No.\u00a0157 to fiscal years beginning after November\u00a015, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized\nor disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.\u00a0157-3, \n\nDetermining the\nFair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active\n\n, to clarify the application of SFAS 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. FSP 157-3 became effective upon issuance and SFAS No.\u00a0157 is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after November\u00a015, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.\u00a0157, management does not currently believe\nadoption will have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\nIn February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.\u00a0159,\n\n\nThe Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\u0097including an amendment of FASB Statement No.\u00a0115.\n\n SFAS No.\u00a0159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at\nfair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No.\u00a0159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No.\u00a0159 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after November\u00a015, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and\nexcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of\ncash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. The Company\u0092s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred\nrevenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iPhone. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s short-term investment portfolio is invested\nprimarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-A. As of September\u00a027, 2008 and September\u00a029, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\nwere held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from\none to five years, as of September\u00a027, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September\u00a029, 2007. The\nCompany has\u00a0the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. Accordingly,\u00a0none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the Company\u0092s\nStatement of Operations.\n\n \n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its\nworking capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\n \n\nCapital Assets \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008,\nconsisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital\nasset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\n \n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative\ninstruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market\nrisk, or credit risk support to the Company. \n\n \n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum\nfirm commitments as of September\u00a027, 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company\u0092s balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\u00a0Due\n\nin Less\n\nThan 1 Year\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n1-3 Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n4-5 Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\u00a0Due\n\nin More\n\nThan 5 Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOperating leases\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,760\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n195\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n409\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n368\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n788\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPurchase obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,378\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n5,378\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsset retirement obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n28\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n471\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n242\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n105\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a07,637\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a05,815\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0541\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0480\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0801\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLease Commitments \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a027, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company\u0092s major\nfacility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain\nmulti-year renewal options. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished\nproducts. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such\npurchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for\nunder subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.\u00a097-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September\u00a027, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component\npurchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion. \n\n \n\nDuring 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix\nSemiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion\nfor flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September\u00a027, 2008. \n\n \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s asset retirement\nobligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September\u00a027, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would\nbe required to fulfill these obligations. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n50 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nOther outstanding obligations were $471 million as of September\u00a027, 2008, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations. \n\n \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax\nbenefits as current liabilities, but beginning with the adoption of FIN 48 the Company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as\nnon-current liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September\u00a027, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $506 million and gross interest and penalties of $219 million, both of which are classified as\nnon-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore,\nsuch amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnifications \n\n \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party\nintellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an\nindemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a\nliability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of\neither September\u00a027, 2008 or September\u00a029, 2007. \n\n ",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \n\n \n\nThe Company\nregularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s\nrisk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition,\nthe timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may\nadversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income and expense is\nmost sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those investments,\nas well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s short-term investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve\ncapital and meet liquidity requirements. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio\nis benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to market risk for changes in\ninterest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s investment\npolicy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\ncash \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n51 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequivalents, while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term\ninvestments. As of September\u00a027, 2008 and September\u00a029, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remainder\nall had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no\nmaterial net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with\nthe Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield\ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a027, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of\nSeptember\u00a029, 2007, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments\nprior to maturity. \n\n \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n \n\nIn general,\nthe Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed\nin U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing\nassets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures,\ntypically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging\ninstruments. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000\nrandom market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual\nlosses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions.

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nBecause of\nthe following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n \n\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely\naffect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions.\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values,\nwhich could have a material negative effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside\nthe U.S. to offset the effect of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a trend that has been very pronounced recently. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and\nmortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the\nCompany\u0092s products and services and on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn the event of\nrenewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in\nthe credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. In addition, the risk remains that there\u00a0could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the\nCompany\u0092s business, including the insolvency of key suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain\ncredit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u0092s products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively impacting the Company\u0092s treasury\noperations. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and\nequity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk\nof the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the\nvolatility of the Company\u0092s stock price. \n\n \n\nGlobal markets for personal computers, mobile communication devices, digital\nmusic and video devices, and related peripherals and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price\ncutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of\ntechnological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly\nthe entire solution for its personal computers, mobile communication devices, and consumer electronics, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant\ninvestments in research and development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of\nthe Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe\non the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nIn the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader\nproduct lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based\npersonal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government and creative markets. An increasing number\nof Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u0092s existing products. \n\n \n\nThe Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by\ncomputer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain functional\nand design advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies\u0092 hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company\u0092s hardware products, and could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is currently focused on certain mobile communication devices, such as iPhone,\nconsumer electronic devices, including the iPod family of digital music and video players and third-party digital content and applications distribution. The Company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical,\nmarketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\nhas only recently entered the mobile communications market, and many of its competitors in the mobile communications market have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and\npotential competitors have substantial resources and experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as\ncompetitors attempt to\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nimitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\n \n\nThe Company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone. There\nis no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\n \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\n\n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics\nindustries, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions\ndepends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of\napplication software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and\nthe risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and\noperating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net\nrealizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an\nasset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its inventory\nand other asset related provisions are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the global personal computer, mobile communication, and consumer electronics industries, the\nCompany will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges. Such charges have, and could, materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally\nacquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing\nrequirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient\ninventories of components or products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and\nrespond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\n \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability\nto obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities. \n\n \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and ASICs, from single or limited sources, the\nCompany is\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nsubject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other key components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, DRAM and certain\nLCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory,\nDRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. The follow-on\neffects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the Company\u0092s key suppliers, referred to in \u0093\n\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the\nCompany\u0092s ability to obtain key components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2009 and 2008, due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on new\nand innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar and higher logistical costs. For additional information refer to Part II, Item\u00a07,\n\u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093Gross Margin,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n \n\nThe Company and other participants in the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer, mobile communication and consumer electronics industries.\nThe Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those\nsuppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. If the supply of a key single-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or\nconstrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be\nmaterially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided\nby third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nMost of the Company\u0092s components and products are\nmanufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and are concentrated in several general locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and\nlogistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity\nof products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company\u0092s supplier code of conduct. Although arrangements with such\nmanufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether\npursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nFinal assembly of the Company\u0092s products is currently performed in the Company\u0092s manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by external vendors in California, Texas, China, the\nCzech Republic and Korea. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Germany, Ireland, Israel Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines,\nTaiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\u0092s portable Mac products, iPhones, iPods and most of the Company\u0092s desktop products. If manufacturing or logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including\nnatural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely\naffected. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on third-party digital content and applications, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content\nand applications through the Company\u0092s iTunes Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to audio and video content. The Company\u0092s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the\ncontinuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for\nthe Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide\nvariety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nMany third-party content providers require that the Company provide certain digital rights management (\u0093DRM\u0094) and other security\nsolutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely\nmanner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the\nCompany\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the\nCompany\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products\nand business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on\nacceptable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nBecause of technological changes in the global personal computer, mobile communication and\nconsumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company\u0092s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other\nintellectual property rights of third parties. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. At present, the Company\nis vigorously defending more than 47 patent infringement cases, 27 of which were filed during fiscal 2009, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into\nlicensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages.\nIf there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. While in management\u0092s opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from\nany known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results, the\nresults of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several of these matters be resolved against the\nCompany in the same reporting period, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nWith the June 2007 introduction of iPhone, the Company has begun to compete with mobile communication device companies that hold significant patent portfolios.\u00a0Regardless of the scope or validity of\nsuch patents or\u00a0the merits of any\u00a0potential patent claims by competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into expensive agreements or settlements and/or\u00a0modify its products. Any of these events could\nhave a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future\nperformance depends on support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPhones and iPods, are\noften based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company\u0092s products\non a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these applications and services could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and\nanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its\nproducts, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes\ndevelopers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger\nWindows market. The Company\u0092s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as Microsoft, Adobe and Google, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or\ncompetitive software and services for the Company\u0092s products. Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard (\u0093Mac OS X Leopard\u0094), which became available in October 2007, includes a new feature that enables Intel-based Mac systems to run Microsoft\nWindows XP and Windows Vista operating systems. This feature may deter developers from creating software applications for Mac OS X if such applications are already available for the Windows platform. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iPhone and iPod touch, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative\nsoftware applications. Unlike third-party software applications for Mac products, the software applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple\ndistribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for\nthe Company\u0092s platforms. In addition, iPhone and iPod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and\nmay result in dissatisfied customers. Further, if the Company develops its own software applications and services, such development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or\ncompetitive applications for the iPhone and iPod touch platforms. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the\nrelative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 products, including devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and\nquality of applications for the Company\u0092s devices may suffer. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of\ndistributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national\nand regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to\nend-users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online and retail stores. iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. \n\n\n\n\nMany resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some\nresellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing\nresources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial\ncondition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company\u0092s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u0092s\nproducts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs\ncould require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nretail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThrough September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had opened 273 retail stores. The Company\u0092s retail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information\nsystems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for ten years. Certain stores have been designed and\nbuilt to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than\nthe Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease\ntermination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs\nassociated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside\nthe U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\n \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant\nrisks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered\nin the Company\u0092s due diligence. Because\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthese new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services experience quality problems from time to time\nthat can result in decreased sales and operating margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells highly complex hardware and software products\nand services that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s\nintended operation. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure\nto do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn certain countries, including the U.S., the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nIn the U.S., Germany, Spain, Ireland and certain other countries, the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide\ncellular network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If these exclusive carriers cannot successfully compete with other carriers in their markets on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data\nservices, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms of conditions of end-user contracts, or if these exclusive carriers fail to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion\nand sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks\nassociated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications devices. \n\n \n\nLaws and\nregulations related to mobile communications devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes, which\u00a0could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture,\ndistribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier\u0092s network, could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n \n\nMobile communication devices, such as iPhone, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and\nstandardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in\nproduct shipment dates, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of\nthe Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its CEO, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the\ntechnology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract\nand retain key personnel. \n\n \n\nIn addition, the Company has relied on equity awards in the form of stock options and restricted\nstock units as one means for recruiting and retaining highly skilled talent. Significant adverse volatility in the Company\u0092s stock price could result in a stock option\u0092s exercise price exceeding the underlying stock\u0092s market value or\na significant deterioration in the value of restricted stock units granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of stock-based awards for retaining employees. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nPolitical events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other\ncircumstances could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health\nissues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers,\nmanufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health\nissues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive\ncomponents from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel\nrestrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing\nvendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and\nmanufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. \n\n \n\nThe Company may\nbe subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security. \n\n \n\nInformation\ntechnology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors including without limitation earthquakes, fire, theft, or other causes could disrupt the Company\u0092s operations by causing delays or cancellation\nof customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company\u0092s online, iTunes, MobileMe and retail offerings and services, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial\nresults, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company\u0092s reputation. While management has taken steps to address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal\ncontrol measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and\nservice and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product\ntransitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition,\nthe Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases,\nstrengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season\nand the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price continues to be volatile. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due to a number of factors, including but not limited to\nvariations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume\nfluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Furthermore, the Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and\nprofitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company derives a large and growing\nportion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that apply to the Company\u0092s international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, the\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of\ndoing business in foreign jurisdictions, and such costs may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation. Furthermore, the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate\ncompliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies. Any such violations could individually or\nin the aggregate materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, political instability, and changes in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and certain parts of Asia, as well as non-U.S. dollar denominated operating\nexpenses incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the\nCompany to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar\u0092s\nstrengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components\ndenominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n \n\nThe Company has used derivative instruments, such as\nforeign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of\nunfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to\ncredit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. \n\n \n\nAlthough the Company has not recognized any\nmaterial losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature\nof its business, the Company has investments\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n22 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nboth domestically and internationally. Additionally, the Company\u0092s overall investment portfolio has concentrations in the financial sector, which has been negatively impacted by adverse\nmarket liquidity conditions in the recent past. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the\nCompany\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is\nheightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nA substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by contract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final\nproducts for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on\nits trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition\nand operating results. \n\n \n\nThe matters relating to the Company\u0092s past stock option practices and its restatement of\nconsolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investigation into its past\nstock option practices and its restatement of prior financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September\u00a030, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. As described in Part I, Item\u00a03,\n\u0093Legal Proceedings,\u0094 several derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors. These actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive\nsettlement. Two former officers of the Company were also named as defendants in an SEC enforcement action, which has been settled. \n\n \n\nNo assurance can be given that additional actions will not be filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. If such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the\nremedies could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nUnfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal\nproceedings and claims that have arisen out of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit,\nlitigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material settlements.\nShould the Company fail to prevail in certain matters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that\nwould materially adversely affect a portion of its business and might materially affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may require the\nCompany to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of its useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in\nwhich the Company\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n23 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\noperates, including various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on\nthe nature of its operations and the focus of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or future laws will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nChanges in the Company\u0092s tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect\nits future results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The\nCompany\u0092s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their\ninterpretation. In addition, the current administration and Congress have recently announced proposals for new U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect the Company\u0092s tax rate. Any of these changes could have a material\nadverse affect on the Company\u0092s profitability. The Company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition\nand operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance. \n\n\n\n\n \n\nFor certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability.\u00a0Because the\nCompany retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the\nCompany\u0092s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. The Company assumes no\nobligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n \n\nExecutive Overview\n\n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, mobile communication devices, and portable digital\nmusic and video players and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company\u0092s products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, iPhone, the iPod line of portable\ndigital music and video players, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory,\nservice and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety\nof third-party Mac, iPhone and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to\nconsumer, small and mid-sized business (\u0093SMB\u0094), education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB,\neducation, enterprise, government and creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles and work environments. The Company\u0092s overall business strategy is to control the design and development of the hardware and software\nfor all of its products, including the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics devices. The Company\u0092s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating system, hardware, application\nsoftware, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the\ndevelopment and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and host a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through\nthe iTunes Store. Most recently the Company launched the App Store that allows users to browse, search for, and purchase third-party applications through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iPhone or\niPod touch. The Company also desires to support a community for the development of third-party products that complement the Company\u0092s offerings through its developer programs. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and\nwell-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions. \n\n \n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets,\nincluding personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, mobile communications with iPhone, consumer electronics with its iPod product families, and distribution of third-party digital content and applications through its online iTunes\nStore. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content and applications,\nthese markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position\nin the markets where it competes. The Company\u0092s research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital\nlifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand\nawareness. \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of\nits innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on Mac\ncomputers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing\ncustomers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and in\ninternational markets. The Company had 273 stores open as of September\u00a026, 2009. \n\n \n\nThe Company has also invested in\nprograms to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations, and the Apple Premium Reseller Program, through which independently run\nbusinesses focus on the Apple platform and provide a high level of customer service and product expertise. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac\ncomputers and other products over those of its competitors.\u00a0The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its direct sales force. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes iPhone in over 80 countries, through its direct channels, its cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. The\nCompany has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network carriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhones. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the\nU.S., Germany, Spain, Ireland and certain other countries. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n36 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to\nprovide broad access. iPods can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above. \n\n \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its\nfinancial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u0094 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n \n\nManagement believes the\nCompany\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of marketable securities, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income\ntaxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments\nand estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet\nsales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, third-party digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and\napplications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions (e.g., Mac computers, iPhones and iPod portable digital music\nand video players). For products that are not software or software-related, (e.g., third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPhone and iPod supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to various\nrevenue-related GAAP as described below. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,\ndelivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s\nproduct sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer\nreceives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,\nrevenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. \n\n \n\nFor both iPhone and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Accordingly, iPhone\nhandsets and Apple TV sales are accounted for under subscription accounting in accordance with GAAP. As such, the revenue and associated cost of sales are deferred at the time of sale, and are both recognized on a straight-line basis over the\ncurrently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. If the Company\u0092s estimated economic life of a product accounted for under subscription accounting changes, the\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nfuture rate at which deferred revenue and deferred costs are recognized in the Company\u0092s results of operations will change. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing\nand warranty are expensed as incurred. \n\n \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price\nprotection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to\nbe refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not\nrecognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at\nwhich the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase\ncustomer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to\nestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of\ncustomers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such investments are sold or an other-than-temporary\nimpairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any investment is\nother-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company\nevaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely\nthan not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment\u0092s amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could change in the future due to\nnew developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment. \n\n \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party distributors, cellular network carriers, and resellers and directly to certain\neducation, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does\nattempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing\narrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade\nreceivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company\u0092s distribution and retail channel partners. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\u0092s assessment of the ability\nto collect specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit-worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably\nbelieves to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the\nCompany\u0092s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer\u0092s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major\ncustomer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect its results of operations in the period the\nadjustments are made. \n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products,\nincluding third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors\nincluding demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, mobile communications and consumer electronics industries are subject to a rapid and\nunpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the\nutility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be\ncancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s\nrequirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s\nproducts, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n \n\nWarranty Costs \n\n \n\nThe Company\nprovides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product\nfailures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to\nwarranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.\u00a0If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates,\nrevisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software\u0092s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for as warranty cost that is\nrecognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost and\nestimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with GAAP, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and\nliability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and\ntax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company\nrecords a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes and measures uncertain tax positions in accordance with GAAP, whereby the Company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood\nof being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including\nincome that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company\ndetermines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the\ncalculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations\ncould have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\n\n \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Note 8,\n\u0093Commitments and Contingencies\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records a\nliability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In\nmanagement\u0092s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.\nHowever, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against\nthe Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nNet Sales \n\n \n\nFiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first\nfiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of

Several factors contributed positively to these increases, including\nthe following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\niPhone revenue and net sales of related products and services amounted to $6.8 billion in 2009, an increase of $4.9 billion or 266% compared to\n2008. iPhone handset unit sales totaled 20.7\u00a0million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1\u00a0million or 78% during 2009 compared to 2008. This growth is attributed primarily to expanded distribution and strong overall demand for\niPhones. iPhone 3GS was released in the U.S. on June\u00a019, 2009 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2009. iPhone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription\naccounting over the product\u0092s currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and carrier agreements. The year-over-year iPhone revenue growth is also largely attributable to the year-over-year\nincrease in iPhone handset unit sales in both 2009 and 2008, which generated significant amounts of deferred revenue that is being recognized over the iPhone\u0092s estimated economic life. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music-related products and services increased $696 million or 21% during 2009 compared to 2008. The increase was due\npredominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the Company\u0092s geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The\nCompany believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content and applications, continued growth in its customer base of iPod and iPhone customers, the expansion of third-party audio\nand video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the continued interest in and growth of the App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings around the world.\n\n\n \n\nPartially offsetting the favorable factors discussed above, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted\nby certain factors, including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, although Mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. Net sales per Mac unit sold\ndecreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all Mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales of Macs accounted for 38% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2009.\nDuring 2009, Mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. This growth was driven by strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008, and experienced double\ndigit net sales and unit growth in each of the Company\u0092s reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. The Company also had a higher product mix of portable systems, which is consistent with the overall market trends.\nHowever, net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in net sales of Mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product mix towards\nlower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all Mac desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. iPod unit sales decreased slightly by 1% during 2009 compared to\n2008. Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the iPod product lines, which were due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new\niPods in\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n42 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSeptember 2009 and September 2008 and a stronger U.S. dollar, offset partially by a higher product mix of iPod touch. \n\n \n\nFiscal Year 2008 versus 2007 \n\n \n\nNet sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7\u00a0million units or 38%. Net sales\nrelated to the Company\u0092s Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Company\u0092s total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Company\u0092s Mac portable\nproducts as well as the popularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Company\u0092s reportable segments. Unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac portable products accounted for 62% of the\nCompany\u0092s personal computer shipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the Mac\nportable products, particularly the MacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Company\u0092s Mac portable product line in January 2008.\nGrowth of the Company\u0092s Mac desktop systems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod\nunit growth was due to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices\ncaused by a shift in overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. Net sales of\niPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal quarter. iPhone revenue includes the portion of handset revenue recognized in the relevant period in accordance with subscription accounting\nover the product\u0092s currently estimated 24-month economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier agreements. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly\nincreased net sales from the iTunes Store in each of the Company\u0092s geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party\naudio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world. \n\n \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\n \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u0092s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Retail. The Americas, Europe and Japan reportable segments do not include\nactivities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the\nU.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company\u0092s operating segments\nmay be found in Note 9, \u0093Segment Information and Geographic Data\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n43 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nAmericas \n\n \n\nDuring 2009, net sales in the Americas segment increased $1.6 billion or 11% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales during 2009 was attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone\nrevenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of Mac portable systems, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Mac desktop systems and iPods. Americas Mac net sales\ndecreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while Mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in Mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for the MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and\nOctober 2008. The Americas segment represented approximately 44% and 45% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n \n\nDuring 2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch,\nMac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments as well as stronger demand for iPhones in the fourth\nquarter of 2008. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961\u00a0million or 32% is attributable to growth in sales of all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net\nsales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Company\u0092s total net sales as compared to 48%\nin the same period of 2007. \n\n \n\nEurope \n\n \n\nDuring 2009, net sales in Europe increased $1.7 billion or 23% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales was due mainly to increased iPhone revenue and Mac portable systems, offset partially by lower\nnet sales of Mac desktop systems, iPods, and a stronger U.S. dollar. Mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven primarily by increased sales of Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook Pro, while total Mac net sales\ndeclined as a result of lower average selling prices across all Mac products. Although iPod net sales decreased in Europe year-over-year as a result of lower average selling prices, iPod unit sales increased due to iPod touch and market share\nincreases. The Europe segment represented 26% and 23% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n \n\nEurope\u0092s net\nsales and Mac unit sales increased 40% and 39%, respectively, during 2008 compared to 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to\nthe increase in net sales were higher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to stronger demand for the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February\n2008, as well as sales of the MacBook Air, introduced in January 2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008,\nconsistent with 2007. \n\n \n\nJapan \n\n \n\nJapan\u0092s net sales increased $322 million or 21% in 2009 compared to 2008. The key contributors to this growth were increased iPhone revenue, stronger demand for certain Mac portable systems and\niPods, and strength in the Japanese Yen, partially offset by decreased sales of Mac desktop systems. Net sales and unit sales of Mac portable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for MacBook Pro, which\nwas updated in June 2009 and October 2008. Net sales and unit sales of iPods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. \n\n \n\nJapan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared to 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales\nfrom the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008 compared to 2007, driven by\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n44 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nstrong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in sales of iMac and Mac portable\nsystems, particularly MacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008. \n\n \n\nRetail \n\n \n\nRetail net sales increased $259 million or 4% during 2009 compared to 2008. The growth in net sales was driven largely by increased iPhone\nrevenue and Mac portable systems, offset partially by a decrease in sales of iPods and Mac desktop systems. The Company opened 26 new retail stores during 2009, including a total of 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. This\ncompares to 247 stores open as of September\u00a027, 2008 and 197 open stores as of September\u00a029, 2007. \n\n \n\nThe\nyear-over-year growth rate of Retail net sales was less than the increase in the average number of stores open during the same period, which the Company believes reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment and continued third-party\nchannel expansion, particularly in the U.S. where most of its stores are located. With an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $25.9 million for 2009 from $29.9\nmillion in 2008. \n\n \n\nThe Retail segment\u0092s net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased\nsales of Mac portable and desktop systems, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail stores during 2008, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September\u00a027, 2008. This\ncompares to 197 open stores as of September\u00a029, 2007. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008 from $23.1 million in 2007. \n\n\n\n\nAs measured by the Company\u0092s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.4 billion during 2009,\nas compared to operating income of $1.3 billion and $875 million during 2008 and 2007, respectively. This increase in operating income in 2009 was driven by increased total Retail net sales attributable to a 20% increase in average stores open and\nhigher gross margin percentage consistent with that experienced Company-wide. The Retail segment\u0092s operating income increased by $462 million during 2008 as compared to 2007 due primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as\ncompared to 2007. \n\n \n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed\nassets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $369 million in 2009, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception\nof the Retail segment to $1.8 billion. As of September\u00a026, 2009, the Retail segment had approximately 16,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related\nfacilities of $1.5 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nOther Segments \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in net sales of $165 million, or 7%, during 2009 as compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iPhone and Mac portable\nsystems offset partially by a decline in sales related to iPods and Mac desktop systems in the Asia Pacific region, as well as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies. Mac net sales and unit sales\ngrew in the Asia Pacific region by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the MacBook Pro. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nOther Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems,\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n45 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\niPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Company\u0092s Asia Pacific region.

The primary\ndrivers of the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were significantly lower commodity and other product costs and a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins, which were partially offset by product price reductions. Gross margin\npercentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in\nfuture periods compared to levels achieved during 2009 and anticipates gross margin levels of about 34% in the first quarter of 2010. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on\nnew and innovative products that have higher cost structures, and both expected and potential future cost increases for key components. \n\n \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to\ncertain of those set forth below in Part I, Item\u00a01A, \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 under the subheading \u0093\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,\nNAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities\n\n,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross\nmargins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product\ntransitions and expected increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (\u0093DRAM\u0094) and liquid crystal displays (\u0093LCDs\u0094), as well as potential\nincreases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take\nproduct pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due\nto the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for the three years ended\nSeptember\u00a026, 2009, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,333\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,109\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n782\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,149\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,761\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a02,963\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11.6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12.3%\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n46 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nResearch and Development (\u0093R&D\u0094) \n\n \n\nR&D expenditures increased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases were due primarily to an\nincrease in headcount and higher stock-based compensation expenses in the current year to support expanded R&D activities. In addition, $71 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from\nR&D expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. Although total R&D expense increased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 12% increase in\nrevenue in 2009. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are\ncentral to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. \n\n \n\nExpenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2008 and higher stock-based compensation\nexpenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software development costs related\nto Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone software. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. \n\n \n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense (\u0093SG&A\u0094) \n\n \n\nSG&A expenditures increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. These increases are due primarily to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both\ndomestic and international markets, higher stock-based compensation expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. \n\n \n\nExpenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant\nyear-over-year increase in total net sales and the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008\ncompared to 2007. \n\n \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\n \n\nOther income and expense for the three years ended September\u00a026, 2009, are as follows (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0407\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0653\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0647\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther income (expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(81\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(33\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(48\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income and expense\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n326\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n620\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income and expense decreased $294 million or 47% to $326 million during\n2009 compared to $620 million and $599 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant decline in interest rates during 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007, partially offset by\nthe Company\u0092s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.43%, 3.44% and 5.27% during 2009, 2008 and\n2007, respectively. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $16 million and $121 million as of September\u00a026, 2009 and September\u00a027, 2008, respectively, which were offset by gross\nunrealized gains of $73 million and $4 million as of September\u00a026, 2009 and September\u00a027, 2008, respectively. The net unrealized gains\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n47 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nas of September\u00a026, 2009 and the net unrealized losses as of September\u00a027, 2008 related primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company considers the declines in market value\nof its marketable securities investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized losses on the Company\u0092s marketable securities were caused primarily by changes in market interest rates, specifically widening credit spreads. The\nCompany does not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not the Company will be required to sell, any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Accordingly, no material declines in fair value were recognized in the\nCompany\u0092s Consolidated Statements of Operations during 2009, 2008 and 2007.\u00a0The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for\nduration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales. \n\n \n\nProvision\nfor Income Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates were 29%, 30% and 30% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The\nCompany\u0092s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be\nindefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from\ndeductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $3.2 billion before being offset against certain deferred liabilities of $1.8 billion for presentation on the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Management believes it is more\nlikely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred\ntax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. \n\n \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The\nCompany has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax\nauthorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the\nCompany\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\n \n\nIn September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (\u0093FASB\u0094) amended the Accounting Standards Codification (\u0093ASC\u0094) as summarized in Accounting Standards Update (\u0093ASU\u0094) 2009-14, \n\nSoftware (Topic 985):\nCertain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements\n\n, and ASU 2009-13, \n\nRevenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements\n\n. As summarized in ASU 2009-14, ASC Topic 985 has been amended to remove from the\nscope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions, tangible products containing software components and non-software components that function together to deliver the product\u0092s essential\nfunctionality. As summarized in ASU 2009-13, ASC Topic 605 has been amended (1)\u00a0to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist, how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated, and the consideration allocated;\n(2)\u00a0to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor-specific objective evidence (\u0093VSOE\u0094) or third-party evidence of selling price; and\n(3)\u00a0to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method. The accounting changes summarized in ASU 2009-14 and ASU 2009-13 are both effective for fiscal years beginning on\nor after June\u00a015, 2010, with early adoption permitted. Adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n48 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the ASC on its\naccounting and reporting systems and processes; however, at this time the Company is unable to quantify the impact on its financial statements of its adoption or determine the timing and method of its adoption. As of September\u00a026, 2009, total\niPhone and Apple TV deferred revenue and deferred costs were $12.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively. The Company believes that application of these amendments will result in a substantial portion of the revenue associated with the sale of\niPhone and Apple TV and all related cost of sales being recognized at the time of sale. Currently revenue and associated cost of sales for these products are deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the\ncurrently estimated 24-month economic life of the products. \n\n \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2009, the Company adopted FASB ASC\n820, \n\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n\n (formerly referenced as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\u0093SFAS\u0094) No.\u00a0157, \n\nFair Value Measurements\n\n)\n\n,\n\n which defines fair value, provides a framework for\nmeasuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued supplemental guidance that delays the effective date of this new fair value accounting standard to fiscal years beginning after\nNovember\u00a015, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the\nCompany beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of this accounting standard, management does not currently believe adoption of this accounting pronouncement will have a material impact\non the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\nIn December 2007, the FASB issued FASB ASC 805, \n\nBusiness\nCombinations\n\n (formerly referenced as SFAS No.\u00a0141 (revised 2007), \n\nBusiness Combinations\n\n), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets\nacquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. This new accounting standard also establishes principles regarding how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain\npurchase should be recognized and measured, as well as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. In April 2009, the FASB amended this new accounting standard to require that\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. This new business combination accounting standard is\neffective for fiscal years beginning on or after December\u00a015, 2008 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of 2010 and will apply prospectively to any business combinations completed on or after that date. The effect\nof adoption of this new accounting pronouncement on the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results will depend on the nature of acquisitions completed after the date of adoption. \n\n \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n \n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended September\u00a026, 2009 (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n33,992\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n24,490\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n15,386\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,361\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,422\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,637\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInventories\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n509\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n346\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking capital\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n16,983\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,219\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,728\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnnual operating cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,159\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n9,596\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,470\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had $34.0 billion in cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $9.5 billion from September\u00a027, 2008. The principal component of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $10.2 billion, which was partially offset by payments for\nacquisitions of property, plant and equipment of $1.1 billion. The Company\u0092s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the increase in deferred revenue, net of deferred costs, associated with\nsubscription accounting for iPhone. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n49 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in\nhighly rated securities, generally with a minimum rating of single-A or equivalent. As of September\u00a026, 2009 and September\u00a027, 2008, $17.4 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working\ncapital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\n \n\nCapital Assets \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s cash payments for capital asset\npurchases were $1.1 billion during 2009, consisting of $369 million for retail store facilities and $775 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing\napproximately $1.9 billion for capital asset purchases during 2010, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.5 billion for corporate facilities, infrastructure, and product tooling and manufacturing process\nequipment. \n\n \n\nHistorically the Company has opened between 25 and 50 new retail stores per year. During 2010, the Company expects\nto open a number of new stores near the upper end of this range, over half of which are expected to be located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\n \n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions\nwith unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any\nother obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. \n\n \n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September\u00a026, 2009 and excludes amounts already recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet as current liabilities (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\nLess\n\nThan\n\n1\u00a0Year\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n1-3 Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n4-5 Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\nMore\n\nThan\n\n5\u00a0Years\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOperating leases\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,922\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n222\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n462\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n413\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n825\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPurchase obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,783\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4,783\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAsset retirement obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n32\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n356\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n175\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n129\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0097\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n7,093\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,184\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0469\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0841\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLease Commitments \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion of which related to the lease of retail\nspace and related facilities. The Company\u0092s major facility leases are generally for terms of one to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of one to five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of five to 20\nyears, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract\nManufacturers and Component Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies\nfor the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n50 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nand build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products\nfrom a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase\ncommitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for under\nsubscription accounting whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component purchase commitments and estimated\nwarranty commitments of $4.8 billion. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply\nof certain inventory components. During the first quarter of 2009, a long-term supply agreement with Intel Corporation was terminated and the remaining prepaid balance of $167 million was repaid to the Company. During the second and fourth quarters\nof 2009, the Company made a prepayment of $500\u00a0million to LG Display for the purchase of LCD panels and a prepayment of $500 million to Toshiba to purchase NAND flash memory, respectively. As of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had a total\nof $1.2 billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding. \n\n \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original\ncondition upon lease termination. As of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $32 million would be required to fulfill these obligations. \n\n \n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nOther\noutstanding obligations were $356 million as of September\u00a026, 2009, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2009, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $971 million and an additional $291 million for gross interest and penalties classified as\nnon-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce its unrecognized tax benefits by between $105 million and $145 million in the next 12\u00a0months. At\nthis time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual\nobligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnifications \n\n \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other\nagreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,\nthe Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved\ninfringement claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September\u00a026, 2009 or\nSeptember\u00a027, 2008. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers.\nUnder these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n51 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due\nto the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and\npayments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the\ntiming of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely\naffect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s\ninterest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the\nfair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investment\npolicy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy\nand to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of\ncredit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid\ninvestments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument\u0092s underlying\ncontractual maturity date. All short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated\nmaturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no material net gains or losses during 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to such sales. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed\na sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a026, 2009,\na hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September\u00a027, 2008, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield\ncurve would have resulted in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n52 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n \n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions\nto protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s\npractice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to\nimmateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n \n\nTo provide a\nmeaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the\npotential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the\nCompany\u0092s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted\ntransactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $44\nmillion as of September\u00a026, 2009 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of September\u00a027, 2008. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are\ngenerally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future gains and losses associated with\nthe Company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a026, 2009 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and\namount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n53 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations since the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside\nthe U.S. to offset the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, access\nto credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services and the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nIn the event of\nrenewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in\nthe credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. In addition, the risk remains that there\u00a0could be a number of follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the\nCompany\u0092s business, including the insolvency of key outsourced manufacturing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers,\nincluding channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u0092s products and/or customer, including channel partner, insolvencies; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions negatively\nimpacting the Company\u0092s treasury operations. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting\nfrom revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall\neconomic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n\n\n\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions could also continue to increase the volatility of the Company\u0092s stock price.\n\n\n \n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company competes in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product\nlife cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register\nnumerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell\ninnovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nIn the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company\nfaces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and larger installed customer bases. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price\ncompetition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition in key market segments, including consumer, SMB,\neducation, enterprise, government and creative markets. An increasing number of Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u0092s\nexisting products. \n\n \n\nThe Company is currently the only authorized maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority\nmarket share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s\nability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain functional and \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ndesign advantages. Use of unauthorized copies of the Mac OS on other companies\u0092 hardware products may result in decreased demand for the Company\u0092s hardware products, and could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company currently markets\ncertain mobile communication and media devices, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as\nestablished hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s product features and\napplications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital\ncontent and applications. The Company has only recently entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and many of its competitors in these markets have significantly greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than\nthe Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company currently receives subsidies from its exclusive and non-exclusive carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone.\nThere is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\n\n\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n\n\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and\ntransitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number\nof factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability of application software\nfor new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new\nproducts may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated\ndemand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its\nprovisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the\nindustries in which the Company competes. Such charges could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe Company must order\ncomponents for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and,\nwhere appropriate, prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for 30 to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive\nand subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient inventories of components or products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results\nhave been in the past and could be in the future materially adversely affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors,\nNAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities. \n\n \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains\ncertain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and ASICs, from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many of these and other\nkey components that are available from multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory, DRAM and certain LCDs, are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered\ninto certain agreements for the supply of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements\non similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise obtain favorable pricing in the future. The follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the Company\u0092s key suppliers, referred to in \u0093\n\nEconomic conditions could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, which is incorporated herein by reference, also could affect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and/or price increases that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels\nachieved during 2010, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential future component cost and other cost increases. For additional\ninformation refer to Part II, Item\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093Gross Margin,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company and other participants in the personal computer, and mobile communication and media device industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components\navailable from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. If the supply of a key\nsingle-sourced component for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company depends on\ncomponent and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s components and products are manufactured in whole or in part by a few third-party manufacturers. Many of these manufacturers are located outside of the U.S., and\nare concentrated in several general locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over\nproduction and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nproducts or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In addition, the Company relies on third-party manufacturers to adhere to the Company\u0092s supplier\ncode of conduct. Although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated\nproduct defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nFinal assembly of the Company\u0092s products is currently performed in the Company\u0092s manufacturing facility in Ireland, and by\nexternal vendors in California, Texas, China, the Czech Republic and Korea. Currently, the supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced third-party vendors in the U.S., China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Japan,\nKorea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Sole-sourced third-party vendors in China perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u0092s Mac products, iPhones, iPads and iPods. If manufacturing\nor logistics in these locations is disrupted for any reason, including but not limited to, natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues,\nthe Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on\nthird-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany contracts with certain third parties to offer their digital content through the Company\u0092s iTunes Store. The Company\u0092s licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal\nof these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license\ntheir content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the total cost of, such content. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at\nreasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\nMany third-party content providers require that the Company provide certain digital rights management (\u0093DRM\u0094) and other\nsecurity solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a\ntimely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements with the\nCompany\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party patents and intellectual property, and the\nCompany\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products are designed to include third-party intellectual property, and in the future the Company may need to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products\nand business methods. Although the Company believes that, based on past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms, there is no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on\nacceptable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nBecause of technological changes in the industries in which the Company competes, current\nextensive patent coverage, and the rapid issuance of new patents, it is possible that certain components of the Company\u0092s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFrom time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing such rights. Regardless of merit, responding to such claims can consume significant time and expense. At present, the Company is vigorously defending a number of patent\ninfringement cases, and several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. In certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nassurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. If the Company is found to be infringing such rights, it may be required to pay\nsubstantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requires it to pay royalties to a third party, the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. While in management\u0092s opinion the Company does not have a potential liability for\ndamages or royalties from any known current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition and\noperating results, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others or should several\nof these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\nWith the introduction of iPhones and 3G enabled iPads, the Company has begun to compete with mobile communication and media devices\ncompanies that hold significant patent portfolios.\u00a0Regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0the merits of any\u00a0potential patent claims by competitors, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation, enter into\nexpensive agreements or settlements and/or\u00a0modify its products. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends on support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications\nand services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products, including its Macs, iPhones, iPads and iPods, are often based to a certain extent on the availability of third-party software\napplications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain applications and services for the Company\u0092s products on a timely basis or at all, and discontinuance or delay of these\napplications and services could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part\non the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the\nperceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority share of the\nglobal personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing\nand upgrading software for the larger Windows market. The Company\u0092s development of its own software applications and services may also negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers, such as Microsoft, Adobe and Google, to develop,\nmaintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software and services for the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iPhone,\niPad and iPod touch, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications. Unlike third-party software applications for Mac products, the software applications for the iPhone, iPad and\niPod touch platforms are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party\napplications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to curtail significantly, or stop, development for the Company\u0092s platforms. In addition, iPhone, iPad and iPod touch are subject to rapid technological change, and, if\nthird-party developers are unable to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. Further, if the Company develops its own software applications and services,\nsuch development may negatively affect the decisions of third-party developers to develop, maintain, \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nand upgrade similar or competitive applications for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch platforms. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these\napplications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 products, including devices that use competing platforms. If\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s devices may suffer. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, value-added resellers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers.\nThe Company also sells many of its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers, certain education customers, cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain resellers through its\nonline and retail stores. \n\n \n\nMany resellers operate on narrow operating margins and have been negatively affected in the past by\nweak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage\nresellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely\naffected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the Company\u0092s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing\nof the Company\u0092s products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement\ndisplays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s Retail business has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and\nis subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s retail stores have required substantial fixed\ninvestment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space, with terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of\nwhich are for ten years. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations\nand size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of\nindividual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n \n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and\nuncertainties that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general\nretail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel\npartners, more challenging environment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a\nreasonable cost. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nInvestment in new\nbusiness strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from\ncurrent operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. Because these new ventures\nare inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and\noperating margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells highly complex hardware and software products and services that can contain defects in\ndesign and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. Defects may also occur\nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue,\nharm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn the U.S. the Company relies on a single cellular network carrier to provide service for iPhone. \n\n \n\nIn the U.S. the Company has contracted with a single carrier to provide cellular network services for iPhone on an exclusive basis. If this exclusive carrier cannot successfully compete with other\ncarriers in the U.S. market on any basis, including but not limited to the quality and coverage of wireless voice and data services, performance and timely build-out of advanced wireless networks, and pricing and other terms or conditions of\ncustomer contracts, or if this exclusive carrier fails to promote iPhone aggressively or favor other handsets in their promotion and sales activities or service plans, sales may be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with laws, regulations and industry-imposed standards related to mobile communications and\nmedia devices. \n\n \n\nLaws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which\nthe Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes, which\u00a0could include but are not limited to restrictions on production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier\u0092s network, or\nmandating the use of the device on more than one carrier\u0092s network, could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nMobile communication and media devices, such as iPhones and 3G enabled iPads, are subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network\ncarriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications or delays in product shipment dates, which could materially adversely\naffect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the\ncontinued service and availability of key personnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued\navailability and service of key personnel, including its CEO, its executive team and highly skilled employees in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to attract and retain key personnel. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nPolitical events,\nwar, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and\nthus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters,\nfire, power shortages, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including\npandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps\nof new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology\nsystems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, losses and significant recovery time\ncould be required to resume operations and the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security. \n\n \n\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security caused by such factors, including but not limited to, earthquakes, fire, theft, fraud, malicious attack or other\ncauses could disrupt the Company\u0092s operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer, including channel partner, orders, negatively affecting the Company\u0092s online, iTunes, MobileMe and retail offerings and services, impeding the\nmanufacture or shipment of products, processing transactions and reporting financial results, resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information, or damage to the Company\u0092s reputation. While management has taken steps\nto address these concerns by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures, there can be no assurance that a system failure or loss or data security breach will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a\nvariety of reasons. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The\nCompany\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can\nchange over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales\nthrough its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new\nproducts, component cost increases, strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced greater net sales in the first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to the second and third fiscal quarters due to seasonal\ndemand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year, respectively. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter than it does during either of the first two months.\nDevelopments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s key logistics, components supply, or\nmanufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nstock price continues to be volatile. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility due\nto a number of factors, including but not limited to variations between its actual and anticipated financial results, announcements by the Company and its competitors, and uncertainty about current global economic conditions. The stock market as a\nwhole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Furthermore, the Company believes\nits stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\nretention. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with U.S. and foreign\nlaws and regulations that apply to the Company\u0092s international operations, including without limitation import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), foreign exchange controls and\ncash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these\nlaws and regulations or in their interpretation. Furthermore, the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees,\ncontractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated\nwith international activities, including but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the\nCompany\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade\nregulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. Additionally, the Company is exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance it can\neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada and certain parts of Asia, as well as\nnon-U.S. dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and\nearnings, and generally will lead the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices\nto the full extent of the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while\ngenerally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.\nAdditionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in\nplace. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe Company is\nexposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. \n\n \n\nAlthough the Company has not\nrecognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results,\nor other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables are increased in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be\nlimited. Cellular network carriers accounted for a significant potion of the Company\u0092s trade receivables as of September\u00a025, 2010. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by\ncontract manufacturers and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. Two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the Company\u0092s non-trade receivables as of September\u00a025, 2010. In\naddition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of certain inventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade\nreceivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results.\n\n\n \n\nThe matters relating to the Company\u0092s past stock option practices and its restatement of consolidated financial\nstatements may result in additional litigation. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investigation into its past stock option practices and\nits restatement of prior financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September\u00a030, 2006 gave rise to litigation and government investigations. As described in Part I, Item\u00a03, \u0093Legal Proceedings,\u0094\nseveral derivative and class action complaints regarding stock options were filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors. These actions have been dismissed following a comprehensive settlement. Two former officers of the\nCompany were also named as defendants in an SEC enforcement action, which has been settled. \n\n \n\nNo assurance can be given that\nadditional actions will not be filed against the Company and current and former officers and directors as a result of past stock option practices. If such actions are filed and result in adverse findings, the remedies could materially adversely\naffect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen\nout of the ordinary conduct of its business and are not yet resolved and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of merit, litigation may be both time-consuming and\ndisruptive to the Company\u0092s operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into material settlements. Should the Company fail to prevail in certain\nmatters, or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the Company may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against it that would materially adversely affect a portion of\nits business and might materially affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n20 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe Company is\nsubject to risks associated with laws and regulations related to health, safety and environmental protection. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s products and services, and the production and distribution of those goods and services, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations. These may require the Company to offer customers the ability to return a product at the end of\nits useful life and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various countries within Europe\nand Asia and certain states and provinces within North America. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects based on the nature of its operations and the focus of such laws, there is no assurance such existing laws or\nfuture laws will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nChanges in\nthe Company\u0092s tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u0092s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the current administration and Congress have announced proposals for new U.S. tax\nlegislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect the Company\u0092s tax rate. Any of these changes could have a material adverse affect on the Company\u0092s profitability. The Company is also subject to the continual examination of its income\ntax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no\nassurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and coverage of insurance. \n\n \n\nFor certain risks, the Company does not maintain insurance coverage because of cost and/or availability.\u00a0Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases\nself-insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled\n\u0093Risk Factors\u0094 above, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All\ninformation presented herein is based on the Company\u0092s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters\nof those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n \n\nExecutive Overview \n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets a range\nof personal computers, mobile communication and media devices, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The\nCompany\u0092s products and services include Mac computers, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV, Xserve, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems, third-party digital content and applications\nthrough the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPhone, iPad and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other\naccessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to SMB, education, enterprise, government, and creative markets. \n\n \n\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Company\u0092s business\nstrategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative\nindustrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to the development and enhancement of innovative products and technologies. In conjunction with its strategy, the Company continues to build and\nhost a robust platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. Within the iTunes Store, the Company has expanded its offerings through the App Store and iBookstore, which allow\ncustomers to browse, search for, and purchase third-party applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or by wirelessly downloading directly to an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. The Company also works to support a community for\nthe development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Company\u0092s offerings. Additionally, the Company\u0092s strategy includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers\nand provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle and productivity solutions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac computers; mobile\ncommunications and media devices with its iPhone, iPad and iPod product families; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications with its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the\nmarkets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to\nmaintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company\u0092s research and development spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of personal computers; the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems; application\nsoftware for \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n27 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Mac; iPhone, iPad and iPod and related software; development of new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The\nCompany also believes increased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, including its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers,\nretailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,\ndemonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available on its products, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted\ncustomers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure\na high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the\nCompany has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain\nthird-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise. \n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its\nfinancial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u0094 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and\nliabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n \n\nManagement believes the\nCompany\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal\nand other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about\ninherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet\nsales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has\noccurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales,\nthese criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the\nproduct because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products (e.g., Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods and peripherals), software bundled with hardware\nthat is \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nessential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes\nrevenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled\nwith hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\n \n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include tangible\nproducts containing software essential to the tangible product\u0092s functionality and undelivered software elements relating to the tangible product\u0092s essential software, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their\nrelative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094),\n(ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by\nthe Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\n\n\n\nFor all past and current sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010, the Company indicated it\nmight from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company has identified two deliverables in arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the hardware and\nsoftware essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available\nbasis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating to the product\u0092s essential software. The Company has allocated revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither\nVSOE nor TPE for the two deliverables, the allocation of revenue has been based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the other\nconditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 24-month estimated life of each of these devices. All product cost\nof sales, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs for engineering and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred. If the estimated life of the hardware product should change, the future rate of amortization of\nthe revenue allocated to the software upgrade right will also change. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s process for determining its ESP for\ndeliverables without VSOE or TPE involves management\u0092s judgment. The Company\u0092s process considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. The Company believes its\ncustomers, particularly consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade rights related to iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV. This view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not obligate the Company\nto provide upgrades at a particular time or at all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features will be delivered. Therefore, the Company has concluded if it were to sell upgrade rights on a standalone basis, including those rights\nassociated with iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Apple TV, the selling price would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the Company in developing the ESPs for these upgrade rights include prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, the\nCompany\u0092s historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights (e.g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the product. The Company may also\nconsider, when appropriate, the impact of other products and services, including advertising services, on selling price assumptions when developing and reviewing its ESPs for software upgrade rights and related deliverables. The Company may also\nconsider additional factors as appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if they exist, and product-specific business objectives. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change or should future facts and\ncircumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u0092s ESP for software upgrades related to future sales for these devices could change. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n29 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nBeginning in the third\nquarter of 2010 in conjunction with the announcement of iOS 4, the Company\u0092s ESPs for the embedded software upgrade rights included with iPhone, iPad and iPod touch reflect the positive financial impact expected by the Company as a result of\nits introduction of a mobile advertising platform for these devices and the expectation of customers regarding software that includes or supports an advertising component. iOS 4 supports iAd, the Company\u0092s new mobile advertising platform, which\nenables applications on iPhone, iPad and iPod touch to feature media-rich advertisements within applications. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nrecords reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price\nprotection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u0092s policy\nrequires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later\nof the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future market\nconditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered.\nAdditionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of\nparticular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s results of\noperations. \n\n \n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of investments are included in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax, as reported in the Company\u0092s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of investments impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such investments are sold or an\nother-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if\nany investment is other-than-temporarily impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this\njudgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or\nwhether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of the investment\u0092s amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on whether an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired or not, could\nchange in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular investment. \n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and\nInventory Purchase Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of\nproduct shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company\nperforms a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The industries in which\nthe Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen\ntechnological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n30 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe Company records\naccruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier\ncontracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of\nthe Company\u0092s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of\noperations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n \n\nWarranty Costs \n\n\n\n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on\nhistorical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to\nassess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from\nestimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software\u0092s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is\naccounted for as warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates\nexpected to occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates. \n\n \n\nIncome Taxes\n\n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In\naccordance with GAAP, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the\nfinancial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the\nyears in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company only recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\nsustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,\nincluding income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the\nCompany determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition,\nthe calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s\nexpectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\n\n \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Note 8\n\u0093Commitments and Contingencies\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with GAAP, the Company records a\nliability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In\nmanagement\u0092s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results.\nHowever, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against\nthe Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n32 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nNet Sales \n\n\n\n\nFiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 each spanned 52 weeks.

Net sales per Mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of Mac portable systems.

During 2010, net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac portable systems increased by 18% and 25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in April 2010.

The year-over-year iPhone revenue growth is largely attributable to the year-over-year increase in iPhone handset unit sales. iPhone handset unit sales totaled 20.7\u00a0million during 2009, which represents an increase of 9.1\u00a0million or\n78% during 2009 compared to 2008.

The increase was due\npredominantly to increased net sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, which experienced double-digit growth in each of the Company\u0092s geographic segments during 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. The\nCompany believes this is attributable primarily to continued interest in and growth of the iTunes App Store, continued growth in the Company\u0092s base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod customers, and the expansion of third-party audio and video content\navailable for sale and rent via the iTunes Store \n\n \n\nPartially offsetting the favorable factors discussed\nabove, net sales during 2009 were negatively impacted by certain factors, including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods decreased $1.1 billion or 12% during 2009 compared to 2008. iPod unit sales decreased by 1% during 2009 compared to 2008. Net\nsales per iPod unit sold decreased 11% to $149 in 2009 compared to 2008, resulting from lower average selling prices across all of the iPod product lines, due primarily to price reductions taken with the introduction of new iPods in September 2009\nand September 2008 and a stronger U.S. dollar, offset partially by a higher mix of iPod touch sales. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales declined 3% during 2009 compared to 2008, while Mac unit sales increased by 7% over the same period. Net sales per Mac unit sold\ndecreased by 10% during 2009 compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average selling prices across all Mac portable and desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. Net sales of Macs accounted for 32% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2009.\nDuring 2009, Mac portable systems net sales and unit sales increased by 9% and 20%, respectively, compared to 2008. This growth was driven by strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in June 2009 and October 2008, and which experienced\ndouble-digit net sales and unit growth in each of the Company\u0092s reportable operating segments compared to the same period in 2008. The Company also had a higher mix of Mac portable systems sales, which is consistent with overall personal\ncomputer market trends. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac desktop systems decreased by 23% and 14%, respectively, during 2009 compared to 2008. The decrease in net sales of Mac desktop systems was due mainly to a shift in product\nmix towards lower-priced desktops, lower average selling prices across all Mac desktop systems and a stronger U.S. dollar. \n\n\n\n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\n \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

This increase in net sales was driven by\nincreased iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, continued demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. Americas Mac net sales and unit sales increased 18% and\n21%, respectively, during 2010 compared to 2009, largely due to strong demand for MacBook Pro. The Americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nDuring 2009, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.4 billion or 15% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales during 2009 was\nattributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store, and increased sales of Mac portable systems, partially offset by a decrease in sales of\nMac desktop systems and iPods. Americas Mac net sales decreased 6% due primarily to lower average selling prices, while Mac unit sales increased by 4% on a year-over-year basis. The increase in Mac unit sales was due primarily to strong demand for\nthe MacBook Pro. The Americas segment represented approximately 44% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n \n\nEurope\n\n\n \n\nDuring 2010, net sales in Europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. The growth in net sales was due mainly to\na significant increase in iPhone revenue attributable to continued growth from existing carriers and country and carrier expansion, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and strong demand for iPad, partially offset by a stronger U.S.\ndollar. Europe Mac net sales and unit sales increased 32% and 36%, respectively, during the year due to strong demand for MacBook Pro and iMac. The Europe segment represented 29% and 28% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 and 2009,\nrespectively. \n\n \n\nDuring 2009, net sales in Europe increased $2.6 billion or 28% compared to 2008. The increase in net sales was\ndue mainly to increased iPhone revenue and strong sales of Mac portable systems, offset partially by lower net sales of Mac desktop systems, iPods, and a stronger U.S. dollar. Mac unit sales increased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008, which was driven\nprimarily by increased sales of Mac portable systems, particularly MacBook Pro, while total Mac net sales declined as a result of lower average selling prices across all Mac products. iPod net sales decreased year-over-year as a result of lower\naverage selling prices, partially offset by increased unit sales of the higher priced iPod touch. The Europe segment represented 28% and 25% of total net sales in 2009 and 2008, respectively. \n\n \n\nJapan \n\n \n\nDuring 2010, Japan\u0092s net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75%\ncompared to 2009. The primary contributors to this growth were significant year-over-year increases in iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, and to a lesser extent strength in the Japanese Yen. Mac net sales increased by 8% driven by a 22%\nincrease in unit sales due primarily to strong demand for MacBook Pro and iMac, partially offset by lower average selling prices in Japan on a year-over-year basis. The Japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for\n2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\nJapan\u0092s net sales increased $551 million or 32% in 2009 compared to 2008. The primary\ncontributors to this growth were increased iPhone revenue, stronger demand for certain Mac portable systems and iPods, and strength in the Japanese Yen, partially offset by decreased sales of Mac desktop systems. Net sales and unit sales of Mac\nportable systems increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven primarily by stronger demand for MacBook Pro. Net sales and unit sales of iPods increased during 2009 compared to 2008, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. The Japan\nsegment represented approximately 5% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n36 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nAsia-Pacific \n\n\n\n\nNet sales in Asia-Pacific increased $5.1 billion or 160% during 2010 compared to 2009. The significant growth in Asia-Pacific net sales\nwas due mainly to increased iPhone revenue, which was primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth from existing carriers. Asia-Pacific net sales were also favorably affected by strong demand for Mac portable and\ndesktop systems and for iPad. Particularly strong year-over-year growth was experienced in China, Korea and Australia. The Asia-Pacific segment represented 13% and 7% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nNet sales in Asia-Pacific increased $493 million or 18% during 2009 compared to 2008 reflecting strong growth in sales of iPhone and Mac\nportable systems, offset partially by a decline in sales of iPods and Mac desktop systems, as well as a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and other Asian currencies. Mac net sales and unit sales grew in the Asia-Pacific\nregion by 4% and 17%, respectively, due to increased sales of the MacBook Pro. The Asia-Pacific segment represented approximately 7% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in both 2009 and 2008. \n\n\n\n\nRetail \n\n \n\nRetail net sales\nincreased $3.1 billion or 47% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue.\nMac net sales and unit sales grew in the Retail segment by 25% and 35%, respectively, during 2010. The Company opened 44 new retail stores during the year, 28 of which were international stores, ending the year with 317 stores open compared to 273\nstores at the end of 2009. With an average of 288 stores and 254 stores opened during 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.1 million in 2010, compared to $26.2 million in 2009. The Retail segment represented 15%\nand 16% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\nRetail net sales decreased $636 million or 9%\nduring 2009 compared to 2008. The decline in net sales was driven largely by a decrease in net sales of iPhones, iPods and Mac desktop systems, offset partially by strong demand for Mac portable systems. The year-over-year decline in Retail net\nsales was attributable to continued third-party channel expansion, particularly in the U.S. where most of the Company\u0092s stores are located, and also reflects the challenging consumer-spending environment in 2009. The Company opened 26 new\nretail stores during 2009, including 14 international stores, ending the year with 273 stores open. This compares to 247 stores open as of September\u00a027, 2008. With an average of 254 stores and 211 stores opened during 2009 and 2008,\nrespectively, average revenue per store decreased to $26.2 million for 2009 from $34.6 million in 2008. \n\n \n\nThe Retail segment\nreported operating income of $2.4 billion during 2010 and $1.7 billion during both 2009 and 2008. The increase in Retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales. Despite the decline in Retail net\nsales during 2009 compared to 2008, the Retail segment\u0092s operating income was flat at $1.7 billion in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to a higher gross margin percentage in 2009 consistent with that experienced by the overall company.\n\n\n \n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and\nrelated infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since its inception totaled $2.2 billion through the end of 2010. As of September\u00a025, 2010,\nthe Retail segment had approximately 26,500 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $1.7 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close\nmultiple retail stores and such costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nGross Margin \n\n\n\n\nGross margin for the three years ended September\u00a025, 2010, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n65,225\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n42,905\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n37,491\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39,541\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25,683\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24,294\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n25,684\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n17,222\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,197\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin percentage\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35.2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\nThe gross margin\npercentage in 2010 was 39.4% compared to 40.1% in 2009. This decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to new products that have higher cost structures, including iPad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iPhone, which has a\nhigher gross margin than the Company average. \n\n \n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2009 was 40.1% compared to 35.2% in 2008. The\nprimary contributors to the increase in 2009 as compared to 2008 were a favorable sales mix toward products with higher gross margins and lower commodity and other product costs, which were partially offset by product price reductions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company expects its gross margin percentage to decrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2010 and anticipates\ngross margin levels of about 36% in the first quarter of 2011. This expected decline is largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and expected and potential\nfuture component cost and other cost increases. \n\n \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin\npercentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item\u00a01A, \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 under the subheading \u0093\n\nFuture\noperating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities\n\n,\u0094 which is incorporated herein\nby reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued\nindustry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and expected and potential increases in the cost of key components including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash\nmemory, DRAM and LCDs, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the\nCompany expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to\nstimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n\n\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n\n\n\nOperating expenses for the three years ended September\u00a025, 2010, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,782\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,333\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,109\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2.7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3.0%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,517\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,149\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,761\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8.5%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9.7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10.0%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nResearch and Development Expense\n(\u0093R&D\u0094) \n\n \n\nR&D expense increased 34% or $449 million to $1.8 billion in 2010 compared to 2009. This\nincrease was due primarily to an increase in headcount and related expenses in the current year to support expanded R&D activities. Also contributing to this increase in R&D expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software\ndevelopment costs of $71 million related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Although total R&D expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010. The Company continues\nto believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core\nbusiness strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. \n\n \n\nR&D expense\nincreased 20% or $224 million to $1.3 billion in 2009 compared to 2008. This increase was due primarily to an increase in headcount in 2009 to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. Additionally, $71\nmillion of software development costs were capitalized related to Mac OS X Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense during 2009, compared to $11 million of software development costs capitalized during 2008. Although total R&D expense\nincreased 20% during 2009, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 14% increase in revenue in 2009. \n\n \n\nSelling,\nGeneral and Administrative Expense (\u0093SG&A\u0094) \n\n \n\nSG&A expense increased $1.4 billion or 33% to $5.5 billion\nin 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment, higher spending on marketing and advertising programs, increased stock-based compensation expenses and variable costs\nassociated with the overall growth of the Company\u0092s net sales. \n\n \n\nSG&A expenses increased $388 million or 10% to $4.1\nbillion in 2009 compared to 2008.

The overall decrease in other income and expense is attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the Company\u0092s higher cash,\ncash equivalents and marketable securities balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 0.75%, 1.43% and 3.44% during 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Additionally\nthe Company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense.

The Company\u0092s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate\nof 35% due \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nprimarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax\nrate in 2010 as compared to 2009 is due primarily to an increase in foreign earnings on which U.S. income taxes have not been provided as such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a025, 2010, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax\ncredits of $2.4 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $5.0 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a\nvaluation allowance. \n\n \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s\nfederal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS\naudit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. During the third quarter of 2010, the Company reached a tax settlement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2003. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign\ntax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the\nCompany\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n\n\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n \n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended September\u00a025, 2010 (in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2008\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n51,011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n33,992\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n24,490\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,510\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,361\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,422\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInventories\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,051\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n509\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking capital\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,956\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,049\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,645\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnnual operating cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,595\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,159\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n9,596\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n \n\nAs of\nSeptember\u00a025, 2010, the Company had $51 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $17 billion from September\u00a026, 2009.

The Company\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20\nyears, the majority of which are for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract\nManufacturers and Component Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies\nfor the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods\nranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,\nsupplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n41 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch purchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September\u00a025, 2010, the\nCompany had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $8.2 billion. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire between 2011 and 2015. In August 2010, the Company entered\ninto a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to prepay $500 million in 2011. These prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. \n\n\n\n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nOther\noutstanding obligations were $1.1 billion as of September\u00a025, 2010, which related to advertising, research and development, product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax\nliabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a025, 2010, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $4.3 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a025, 2010, the Company\nhad gross unrecognized tax benefits of $943 million and an additional $247 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of\npayments in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\n\n\n\nIndemnifications \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include\nindemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant\npayments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would\nmaterially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of either September\u00a025, 2010 or September\u00a026, 2009. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company\nhas agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal\nproceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not materially adversely affected the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \n\n \n\nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk\nmanagement activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n42 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nmovements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period\nmay not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n\n\n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the\nCompany\u0092s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, the fair value of those investments, as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s\ninvestment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external manager performance. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its\npolicy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s investment policy requires investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company classifies its marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on\neach instrument\u0092s underlying contractual maturity date. All short-term marketable securities have maturities less than 12 months, while all long-term marketable securities have maturities ranging from one to five years. The Company may sell its\ninvestments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no significant net gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and 2008 related to such sales.\n\n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the\nCompany performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\nSeptember\u00a025, 2010, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September\u00a026, 2009, a similar 100 basis\npoint shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $176 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n\n\n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n\n\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in\nparticular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to\ncompetitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter\ninto foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows,\nand net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for three to six months. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n43 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting considerations and the prohibitive\neconomic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated\nwith certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model\nconsisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse\nmovements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of September\u00a025, 2010 compared to a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $44 million as of September\u00a026, 2009. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the\nunderlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative\npositions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a025, 2010 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates\nand the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n44 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nBecause of\nthe following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n \n\nGlobal economic conditions could materially\nadversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic\nconditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have\na material negative effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to\noffset the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access\nto credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services and the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and\nfinancial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme\nvolatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability\nto obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u0092s products; and failure of\nderivative counterparties and other financial institutions. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges\nresulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; and \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in\nthe\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n \n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If the Company is unable to compete effectively in these markets, its\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services\ncompete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting, with resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual\nimprovement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development and as such, the Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register\nnumerous patents, trademarks and service marks. By contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell\ninnovative new products with attractive margins or if other companies infringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be negatively affected and its financial condition and\noperating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices\nbased on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and\nother resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s\nproduct features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain\nthird-party digital content and applications. The Company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the\nCompany. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also\nexpects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using Mac OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market.\nThis market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product\nlines, lower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. Consolidation in this market has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based\npersonal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with\nthe Company\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and\nservices that compete effectively. \n\n \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully\nmanage frequent product introductions and transitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries\nin which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new\nproduct introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues,\nthe availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on its\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have\nbecome obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or\nchanged circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair\nmarket value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and\nunpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. Such charges could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with\nindustry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments\ntypically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results have been in the past and could be in the future\nmaterially adversely affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\n \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. \n\n \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components that are available from multiple sources\nare at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of components; there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew\nthese agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from the credit crisis on\u00a0the Company\u0092s suppliers, referred to in \u0093\n\nEconomic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\n\n\u0094 above, also could\naffect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfinancial condition and operating results. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to\na higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost and other cost increases. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company and other participants in the mobile communication and media device, and personal computer industries compete for various\ncomponents with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components\navailable from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these\ncomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. If the supply of components for a\nnew or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if a key manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many\nof whom are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in\npart by a few outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control\nover production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these\npartners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. The Company also relies on its partners to adhere to the Company\u0092s\nsupplier code of conduct. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with outsourcing partners or otherwise, or material violations of the supplier code of conduct, could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u0092s reputation, financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe supply and manufacture of many critical components\nis performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Single-sourced outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u0092s hardware products. If manufacturing or logistics in these\nlocations is disrupted for any reason including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on\nthird-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such\nlicenses generally could be obtained on reasonable terms. There is however no assurance that the necessary licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain or renew critical licenses on reasonable terms,\nits financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company also contracts with third\nparties to offer their digital content through the iTunes Store. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some\nthird-party content providers currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. If the\nCompany is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach, the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely\naffected. \n\n \n\nMany third-party content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management (\u0093DRM\u0094) and\nother security solutions. If these requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost\nand in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose legislation that would force the Company to license its DRM, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could affect arrangements\nwith the Company\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future results could be materially adversely affected if it\nis found to have infringed on intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nTechnology companies, including many of the Company\u0092s\ncompetitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained.\nAs the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that\nhold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S.\nInternational Trade Commission, as well as internationally in Europe and Asia. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\n \n\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0the merits of any patent claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is\nfound to infringe one or more patents, it may be required to pay substantial damages. If there is a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products or a successful claim of infringement against\nthe Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, its financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology. \n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given\nthat such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \n\n \n\nIn management\u0092s opinion there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\ncontingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or\nmore of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be\nmaterially adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software\ndevelopers. \n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the\navailability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u0092s products. If third-party software\napplications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating\nresults. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such applications and\nservices. If the Company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s products and\nmore inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\n \n\nWith respect to\niOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution\nchannels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In\naddition, iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied\ncustomers. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the\nCompany\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 products, including devices that use competing platforms. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s\ndevices may suffer. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future operating performance depends on the performance of distributors, carriers\nand other resellers. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers,\nand value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells many of its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education customers, cellular network\ncarriers\u0092 distribution channels, resellers and consumers through its online and retail stores. \n\n \n\nCarriers providing\ncellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchase of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers\nor in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\n \n\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been\nnegatively affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products.\nSuch a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in\nprograms to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no\nassurance of return or incremental revenue. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers stopped distributing the\nCompany\u0092s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s Retail business has required and will continue to require a\nsubstantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nretail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require\nsubstantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties that could\nmaterially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have a negative effect on general retail activity, as well as\nthe Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, inability to sell third-party products at adequate margins, failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging\nenvironment in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\n\n\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present risks not\noriginally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy, inadequate\nreturn of capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. They may materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services experience quality problems from time to time that can result\nin decreased sales and operating margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can\ncontain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. The\nCompany\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to\ndetect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, harm to reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide,\nchanges to which could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S.\nand foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications,\nmobile, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety.\n\n\n \n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which\nthe Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the\nuse of the device on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These\ncertification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\n\n\n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance.\u00a0This increases the costs of doing business, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their\ninterpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the Company\u0092s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, cause the Company to change or limit\nits business practices, or affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the\nCompany\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies. Any such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition\nor operating results.\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key\npersonnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel,\nincluding its CEO, its executive team and highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s\nkey personnel are located. \n\n \n\nPolitical events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other\ncircumstances could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health\nissues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers,\nmanufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile\nacts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers,\nincluding channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively affected\nby more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the\nCompany\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including\ncertain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, losses, significant recovery time and substantial expenditures could be required to resume\noperations and the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease also refer to the discussion of risks related to the March\u00a011, 2011, Japan\nearthquake and tsunami and the recent flooding in Thailand in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 under the subheading \u0093Japan Earthquake and Tsunami\nand Thailand Flooding,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to information\ntechnology system failures or network disruptions that could damage the Company\u0092s reputation, business operations, and financial conditions. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of\nterrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u0092s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u0092s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures\nand disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage the Company\u0092s reputation, business partner and customer relationships, and access to online stores\nand services. Such breaches could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information (\u0093PII\u0094). This may include names, addresses, phone numbers,\nemail addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company may be at a relatively greater risk of\nbeing targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII managed. \n\n \n\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in\norder to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security\nbreaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to Company data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into\ndisclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual\nactivity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and\ndata, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. The Company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results\nin the unauthorized release of PII, the Company\u0092s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease. The Company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and\npossible liability, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII.\nIn many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial\nrelations. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\narea, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging\nand changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on its website. Any failure by the\nCompany, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policies or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings\nagainst the Company by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u0092s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under\nthese rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards,\neven if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins\nthan certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component,\nwarranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin\npercentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company\nhas typically experienced greater net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to other fiscal quarters due to increased holiday seasonal demand. Furthermore, the Company sells more products from time-to-time during the third month of a quarter\nthan it does during either of the first two months. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the\nCompany\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the stock market as a whole has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the stock price of many technology companies in ways that\nmay have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. The Company believes its stock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may\nsignificantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of\nits revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation\nrestrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with\nthese laws and \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. The consequences of such violations could individually or in the aggregate materially\nadversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition or operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes\nin the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected\nby foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in\ncertain international markets. There can be no assurance it can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and\noperating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally will lead the Company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. In some circumstances, due to competition or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to the full extent of the dollar\u0092s strengthening,\nor at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\nalso increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n \n\nThe Company has used derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging\nactivities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. \n\n\n\n\nAlthough the Company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, any\nsignificant declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit\nratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to\nlong-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nThe Company\ndistributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance.\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. Cellular network carriers accounted for a significant portion of\nthe Company\u0092s trade receivables as of September\u00a024, 2011. The \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products\nfor the Company. Two vendors accounted for a significant portion of the Company\u0092s non-trade receivables as of September\u00a024, 2011. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of\ninventory components. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its\ncredit risk and avoid losses, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary conduct of business, and additional claims may arise in the\nfuture. Results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations, and distracting to management. In\nrecognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \n\n \n\nAlthough management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial\ncorporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nChanges in the Company\u0092s tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect its future results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company\u0092s future effective tax rates could be\naffected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Any of these changes could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company\u0092s profitability. The Company is also subject to the continual examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of\nadverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition\nand operating results. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All\ninformation presented herein is based on the Company\u0092s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters\nof those fiscal years. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n \n\nExecutive Overview \n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile\ncommunication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u0092s\nproducts and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and Mac OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company\nalso sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as\nthrough third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, printers,\nstorage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software,\nperipherals, and services. The Company\u0092s business strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with\nsuperior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. As part\nof the iTunes Store, the Company\u0092s App Store and iBookstore allow customers to discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through \u0093iOS devices,\u0094 namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.\nIn January 2011, the Company opened the Mac App Store to allow customers to easily discover, download and install applications for their Macs. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products\nand digital content that complement the Company\u0092s offerings. The Company\u0092s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support\nexperience. \n\n \n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including mobile communications and media devices\nwith its iPhone, iPad and iPod product families; personal computers with its Mac computers; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is\nwidely recognized as a leading innovator in the markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that continual investment in research and development and\nmarketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Company\u0092s research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in further developing\nits existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and Mac OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n25 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail\nstores, online stores, and direct sales force, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable\nsalespersons who can convey the value of the hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an\neffective way to demonstrate the advantages of its products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality\nbuying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has\ninvested in programs to enhance reseller sales by placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party\nresellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a high level of integration and support services, and product expertise. \n\n \n\nJapan\nEarthquake and Tsunami and Thailand Flooding \n\n \n\nOn March\u00a011, 2011, the northeast coast of Japan experienced a severe\nearthquake followed by a tsunami, with continuing aftershocks. These geological events have caused significant damage in the region, including severe damage to nuclear power plants, and have impacted Japan\u0092s power and other infrastructure as\nwell as its economy. Certain of the Company\u0092s suppliers are located in Japan, and certain of its other suppliers integrate components or use materials manufactured in Japan in the production of its products. To the extent that component\nproduction has been affected, the Company has generally obtained alternative sources of supply or implemented other measures. The Company does not currently believe these events will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of\n2012 unless conditions worsen, including, but not limited to, power outages and expansion of evacuation zones around the nuclear power plants. \n\n \n\nBeyond the first quarter of 2012, uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power, the damage to nuclear power plants and the impact to other infrastructure. Thus, there is a risk\nthat the Company could in the future experience delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and products and/or price increases related to such components and products that could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nIn addition, in recent months several regions of Thailand have experienced severe flooding,\ncausing damage to infrastructure, housing and factories. A number of the Company\u0092s suppliers are located in Thailand. As with Japan, to the extent that component production has been affected, the Company will work to obtain alternative sources\nof supply or implement other measures. Based on the Company\u0092s current assessment of the situation, it does not believe this event will have a material impact on its operations in the first quarter of 2012; however, because the situation in\nThailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the Company. \n\n \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nand Estimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts\nreported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u0094 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies\nand methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results\nof which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n26 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement believes the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those\nrelated to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical\nbecause they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management\nhas reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale\nof hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or\ndeterminable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the\nproduct is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a\nportion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold\non the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:\n(i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\n\n\n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the\nCompany uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of the selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect\nthe Company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\n \n\nFor sales of iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, for sales of iPod touch beginning in June 2010, and for sales of Mac beginning in June 2011, the Company has indicated it may from time-to-time provide future\nunspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. In June 2011, the Company announced it would begin providing various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has\nneither VSOE nor TPE for these unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Amounts allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and\nnon-software services are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of each of these devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. The Company\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves management\u0092s judgment. The\nCompany\u0092s process considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated\nor actual costs incurred to provide non-software services or the estimated lives of the related devices, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u0092s ESP for software upgrades and\nnon-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. If the estimated life of one or more of the devices should change, the future rate of amortization of the revenue allocated to the software upgrade rights would also\nchange. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n27 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price\nprotection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to\nbe refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not\nrecognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at\nwhich the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase\ncustomer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to\nestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of\ncustomers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\ninvestments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u0092s\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the\nsale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company\nto record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost, the financial\ncondition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell, the security before recovery of the its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on\nwhether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. \n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company must\norder components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in\nexcess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current\nsales levels, and component cost trends. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the\nCompany\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect its\nresults of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Company records accruals for estimated\ncancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders\nbased on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products or an\nunanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, the Company may be required to \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrecord additional accruals for cancellation fees that would negatively affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n\n\n\nWarranty Costs \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific\nproduct failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products\nsubject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could materially affect the\nCompany\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial\nstatements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing\ntaxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to\nthe valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP\nand complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\n \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Note 7, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies\u0094 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There\nis significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material\nloss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management\nconsiders the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n29 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Sales \n\n \n\nFiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009 each spanned 52 weeks.

Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including\nthe following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010.\niPhone handset unit sales totaled 72.3\u00a0million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3\u00a0million units or 81% compared to 2010. iPhone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iPhone 4 in all of the Company\u0092s\noperating segments. The expanded U.S. distribution of iPhone to the Verizon Wireless network beginning in February 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the\nyear-over-year growth of iPhone. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company distributed iPhone in 105 countries through 228 carriers. Additionally, the Company distributes iPhone through its direct channels and certain third-party resellers. Net\nsales of iPhone and related products and services accounted for 43% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPad and related products and services, which the Company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011,\nrepresenting an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. Unit sales of iPad were 32.4\u00a0million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. The year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong iPad demand in all of\nthe Company\u0092s operating segments. The Company distributes iPad through its direct channels, certain cellular network carriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. The Company distributed iPad in 90 countries as of\nSeptember\u00a024, 2011 compared to 26 countries as of September\u00a025, 2010. Net sales of iPad and related products and services accounted for 19% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. Mac unit sales increased by\n3.1\u00a0million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which were updated in\nJuly 2011 and February 2011, respectively. The year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. Net sales of the Company\u0092s Macs accounted for 20% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010.\nThe increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the iTunes Store, which was largely driven by App Store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the Company\u0092s geographic segments. During 2011, the\ncombined net sales for the iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. The Company believes this continued growth is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party\ndigital content, continued growth in its customer base of iPhone, iPad and iPod, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the iTunes Store, and continued interest in and growth of the App Store. Net sales of other music related\nproducts and services accounted for 6% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011. \n\n \n\nPartially offsetting\nthe positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales of $821 million or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. However, net sales per\niPod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily to a shift in iPod product mix toward iPod touch. Net sales of iPod accounted for 7% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiscal Year 2010 versus 2009 \n\n\n\n\nNet sales during 2010 increased $22.3 billion or 52% compared to 2009. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including\nthe following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $25.2 billion in 2010 representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 93% compared to 2009.\niPhone unit sales totaled 40\u00a0million in 2010, which represents an increase of 19.3\u00a0million or 93% compared to 2009. iPhone year-over-year growth was attributable primarily to continued growth from existing carriers, expanded distribution\nwith new international carriers and resellers, and strong demand for iPhone 4, which was released in the U.S. in June 2010 and in many other countries over the remainder of 2010. As of September\u00a025, 2010, the Company distributed iPhone in 89\ncountries through 166 carriers. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services accounted for 39% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 compared to 30% in 2009. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPad and related products and services were $5.0 billion and unit sales of iPad were 7.5\u00a0million during 2010. iPad was released in\nthe U.S. in April 2010 and in various other countries over the remainder of 2010. As of September\u00a025, 2010, the Company distributed iPad in 26 countries. The Company distributes iPad through its direct channels, certain cellular network\ncarriers\u0092 distribution channels and certain third-party resellers. Net sales of iPad and related products and services accounted for 8% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010, reflecting the strong demand for iPad during the five months\nfollowing its release. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales increased by $3.6 billion or 26% in 2010 compared to 2009, and Mac unit sales increased by 3.3\u00a0million or 31% in 2010 compared to\n2009. Net sales per Mac unit sold decreased by 4% in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to lower average selling prices of Mac portable systems. During 2010, net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac portable systems increased by 18% and\n25%, respectively, primarily attributable to strong demand for MacBook Pro, which was updated in April 2010. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\u0092s Mac desktop systems increased by 43% and 45%, respectively, as a result of higher sales of\niMac, which was updated in July 2010. Net sales of the Company\u0092s Macs accounted for 27% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 compared to 32% in 2009. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services increased $912 million or 23% during 2010 compared to 2009. This increase was due primarily\nto growth of the iTunes Store which generated total net sales of $4.1 billion for 2010. The results of the iTunes Store reflect growth of the iTunes App Store, continued growth in the installed base of iPhone, iPad, and iPod customers, and the\nexpansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings around the world. Net sales of other music related products and services\naccounted for 8% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 compared to 9% in 2009. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPods increased $183 million or 2% during 2010, while iPod unit sales declined by 7% during 2010 compared to 2009. Net sales per iPod\nunit sold increased by 10% to $164 in 2010 compared to 2009, due to a shift in product mix toward iPod touch. iPod touch experienced strong growth in each of the Company\u0092s reportable operating segments. Net sales of iPods accounted for 13% of\nthe Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 compared to 19% in 2009. \n\n \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\n\n\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

The primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4\nand increased sales of iPad and Macs, partially offset by a decrease in iPod net sales. Higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store and App Store also drove an increase in sales during 2011. The Americas\nsegment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n \n\nDuring\n2010, net sales in the Americas segment increased $5.5 billion or 29% compared to 2009. This increase in net sales was driven by increased iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, continued demand for Mac desktop and portable systems, and higher\nsales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store. The Americas segment represented 37% and 44% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\nEurope \n\n \n\nFor 2011, net sales in the Europe segment increased $9.1 billion or\n49%, compared to 2010. The increase in net sales during 2011 was attributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4, and increased sales of iPad and Macs, partially\noffset by a decrease in iPod net sales. The Europe segment represented 26% and 29% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n \n\nDuring 2010, net sales in Europe increased $6.9 billion or 58% compared to 2009. The growth in net sales was due mainly to a significant increase in iPhone revenue attributable to continued growth from\nexisting carriers and country and carrier expansion, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and strong demand for iPad, partially offset by a stronger U.S. dollar. The Europe segment represented 29% and 28% of the Company\u0092s total\nnet sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\nJapan \n\n \n\nJapan\u0092s net sales increased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. The key contributors to Japan\u0092s net sales growth were increased iPhone revenue, strong sales of iPad, increased\nsales of Macs, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The Japan segment represented 5% and 6% of total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe recent earthquakes and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan have created uncertainty regarding general economic and market conditions in Japan. Any significant impact of these events on\nconsumer demand could negatively impact the Company\u0092s net sales in Japan in the future. The Company does not currently believe that the impact of these events will have a material adverse effect on the Company or its results of operations.\n\n\n \n\nDuring 2010, Japan\u0092s net sales increased $1.7 billion or 75% compared to 2009. The primary contributors to this growth\nwere significant year-over-year increases in iPhone revenue, strong demand for iPad, and to a lesser extent strength in the Japanese Yen. The Japan segment represented 6% and 5% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n33 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsia-Pacific \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased $14.3 billion or 174% during 2011 compared to 2010. The Company experienced particularly strong year-over-year net sales growth in its Asia Pacific segment\nduring 2011, especially in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea and Australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. Higher net sales in the Asia Pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iPhone revenue\nprimarily attributable to the strong demand for iPhone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of iPad, and increased sales of Macs. The Asia Pacific segment represented 21% and 13% of total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nNet sales in Asia-Pacific increased $5.1 billion or 160% during 2010 compared to 2009. The significant growth in Asia-Pacific net sales\nwas due mainly to increased iPhone revenue, which was primarily attributable to country and carrier expansion and continued growth from existing carriers. Asia-Pacific net sales were also favorably affected by strong demand for Mac portable and\ndesktop systems and for iPad. Particularly strong year-over-year growth was experienced in China, Korea and Australia. The Asia-Pacific segment represented 13% and 7% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nRetail \n\n \n\nRetail segment\nnet sales increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, higher sales of Macs, and an increase in iPhone revenue. The Company opened 40 new retail stores during\n2011, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 357 stores open compared to 317 stores at the end of 2010. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company had a total of 245 U.S. retail stores and 112 international retail stores.\n\n\n \n\nDuring 2011, the Company had an average of 326 stores compared to an average of 288 stores during 2010. The average revenue\nper store increased 27% to $43.3 million in 2011 compared to $34.1 million in 2010. The Retail segment represented 13% and 15% of total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nRetail net sales increased $3.1 billion or 47% during 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by strong\ndemand for iPad, increased sales of Mac desktop and portable systems and a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue. The Company opened 44 new retail stores during 2010, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 317 stores\nopen compared to 273 stores at the end of 2009. With an average of 288 stores and 254 stores opened during 2010 and 2009, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $34.1 million in 2010, compared to $26.2 million in 2009. The Retail\nsegment represented 15% and 16% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe Retail segment\nreported operating income of $3.3 billion during 2011 compared to $2.4 billion during 2010. The year-over-year increase in Retail operating income was primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average\nrevenue per store during 2011 compared to 2010. The Retail segment reported operating income of $1.7 billion during 2009. The increase in Retail operating income during 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to higher overall net sales. \n\n\n\n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related\ninfrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment since inception totaled $2.8 billion through the end of 2011. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Retail\nsegment had approximately 36,000 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding lease commitments associated with retail space and related facilities of $2.4 billion. The Company would incur substantial costs if it were to close multiple retail\nstores and such costs could adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n34 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGross Margin \n\n \n\nGross margin for the three years ended September\u00a024, 2011, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n108,249\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n65,225\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n42,905\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n64,431\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a039,541\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a025,683\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n43,818\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n25,684\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n17,222\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin percentage\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40.5%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. This year-over-year increase in\ngross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs. \n\n \n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2010 was 39.4%\ncompared to 40.1% in 2009. This year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily attributable to new products that had higher cost structures, including iPad, partially offset by a more favorable sales mix of iPhone, which had a higher gross\nmargin than the Company average. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future\nperiods, as compared to levels achieved during 2011, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers, and potential future component cost\nand other cost increases. \n\n \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage are\nforward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors including, but not limited to certain of those set forth below in Part I, Item\u00a01A, \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 under the subheading \u0093\n\nFuture\noperating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities\n\n,\u0094 which is incorporated herein by reference. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under\ndownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well\nas potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue\nto take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its\nproducts. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\n \n\n \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for the three years ended\nSeptember\u00a024, 2011, are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,429\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,782\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,333\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n7,599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,517\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,149\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development Expense (\u0093R&D\u0094) \n\n\n\n\nR&D expense increased $647 million or 36% to $2.4 billion in 2011 compared to 2010.

Also contributing to this increase in R&D expense in 2010 was the capitalization in 2009 of software development costs of $71 million related\nto Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Although total R&D expense increased 34% during 2010, it declined as a percentage of net sales given the 52% year-over-year increase in net sales in 2010. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the\nmarketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core business strategy.

The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2011 was due primarily to higher interest income and net realized gains on sales of marketable securities. The overall\ndecrease in other income and expense in 2010 compared to 2009 was attributable to the significant declines in interest rates on a year-over-year basis, partially offset by the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nbalances. Additionally the Company incurred higher premium expenses on its foreign exchange option contracts, which further reduced the total other income and expense. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities was 0.77%, 0.75% and 1.43% during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\n\n\n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates were approximately 24.2%, 24.4% and 31.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company\u0092s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory\nfederal income tax rate of \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n36 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax\ncredits of $3.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $9.2 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of a\nvaluation allowance. \n\n \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s\nfederal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS\naudit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result\nfrom tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be\nrequired to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three years ended September\u00a024, 2011 (in\nmillions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2009\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n81,570\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n51,011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n33,992\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,369\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,510\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,361\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInventories\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n776\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,051\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n455\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking capital\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n17,018\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,956\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,049\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnnual operating cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n37,529\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,595\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,159\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities increased $30.6 billion or 60% during 2011. The\nprincipal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $37.5 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of property, plant and equipment of $4.3 billion, payments for acquisition of\nintangible assets of $3.2 billion and payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $244 million. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to\nsatisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly rated securities and its policy generally\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s investment policy requires investments to generally be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. As of September\u00a024, 2011\nand September\u00a025, 2010, $54.3 billion and $30.8 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts\nheld by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. \n\n \n\nCapital Assets \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s capital expenditures were $4.6 billion during 2011, consisting of approximately $614 million for retail store\nfacilities and $4.0 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprocess equipment, real estate for the future development of the Company\u0092s second corporate campus, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure.

Leases for retail space are for\nterms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\nwere $3.0 billion, of which $2.4 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and\nComponent Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s\nproducts and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company\nalso obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based\non projected demand information. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $13.9 billion. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nOther outstanding obligations were $2.4 billion as of September\u00a024, 2011, and were comprised mainly of commitments under long-term supply agreements to make additional inventory component prepayments\nand to acquire capital equipment, commitments to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax\nliabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $8.2 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company\nhad gross unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion and an additional $261 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of\npayments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnification \n\n \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its\noperating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company\ncould be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim\nasserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or\napplication software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of either September\u00a024, 2011 or September\u00a025, 2010. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company\nhas agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal\nproceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \n\n \n\nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management\nactivities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the\nrecognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in\nU.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the\nCompany. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external\nmanager performance. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\u0092s investment policy generally requires investments to be investment\ngrade, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the\ninterest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis\npoint parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a024, 2011, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $913 million incremental decline in the fair\nmarket value of the portfolio. As of September\u00a025, 2010, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $477 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized\nif the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n\n\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in\nparticular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive\npressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign\ncurrency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net\ninvestments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange\nexposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a\nvalue-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions.\nThe VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used\nas a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the\nmodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of September\u00a024, 2011 compared to a \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n40 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum one-day loss in fair value of $103 million as of September\u00a025, 2010.

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nBecause of\nthe following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not\nuse historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n \n\nGlobal economic conditions could materially\nadversely affect the Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic\nconditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values. For example, the\ncontinuing sovereign debt crisis, financial market volatility, and other factors in Europe have resulted in reduced consumer and business confidence and spending in many countries. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to\ncorrespond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare\ncosts, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. \n\n\n\n\nIn the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial\nservices industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets.\nThis\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ndevelopment and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u0092s\nproducts; and failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial\ninstruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial\nmarkets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them.\n\n\n \n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services\ncompete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual\nimprovement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of\ninnovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and\nrelated services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development and currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents,\ntrademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u0092s\u00a0products and\ninfringing\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s\nability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and\nmedia devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate\nthe Company\u0092s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate\nways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company has entered the mobile communications and media device markets, and some of its competitors in these markets have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels\nthan the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide such products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\nalso expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This\nmarket is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines,\nlower priced products, and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nbeen particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that\ninclude software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on\nits ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \n\n \n\nThere can be no\nassurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n \n\nTo remain\ncompetitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products\nand services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market\nacceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in\nline with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the\nCompany cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces\nsubstantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a\nwrite-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews\nits long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has\noccurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, other assets and purchase commitments\nare currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with\nindustry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, open orders and, where appropriate, inventory component prepayments, in each case based on projected demand. Such purchase commitments\ntypically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. \n\n\n\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing\nrisks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of\ncomponents, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nglobal economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u0092s suppliers, described in \u0093\n\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, also could affect\nthe Company\u0092s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. The Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in future\nperiods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative products with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and\nother cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could also negatively impact gross margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company and\nother participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom\ncomponents that are not common to the rest of these industries. The Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist\nuntil the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common\ncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company\u0092s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to\nthe Company. \n\n \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of\nwhom are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in\npart by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control\nover production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these\npartners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. \n\n \n\nThe supply and manufacture of many critical components is performed by sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Outsourcing partners in Asia perform final assembly of substantially\nall of the Company\u0092s hardware products. Manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information\ntechnology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies on third-party intellectual property and digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially\nreasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires\nlicenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on\nacceptable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company also contracts with third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes\nStore. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the\nfuture may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nmay seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with\nacceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. \n\n \n\nMany third-party content providers require the Company to\nprovide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such\nsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of\ncontent and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u0092s content providers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is frequently involved in intellectual property litigation, and could be found to have infringed on intellectual property\nrights. \n\n \n\nTechnology companies, including many of the Company\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on\nallegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property\nrights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of\npatent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally\nin Europe and Asia. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\n \n\nRegardless of the\nscope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming,\ndisruptive to the Company\u0092s operations, and distracting to management. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. \n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given\nthat such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \n\n \n\nIn management\u0092s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\ncontingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or\nmore of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software\napplications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u0092s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be\ndeveloped and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party\nsoftware applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products.\nThis analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of Mac sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the\nCompany\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s products and more inclined to\ndevote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the\nCompany relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are\navailable for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to reduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In addition, iOS devices are\nsubject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with\napplications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather\nthan its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s iOS devices may suffer. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added\nresellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small\nand mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. \n\n \n\nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone\ntypically subsidize users\u0092 purchase of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters\ninto with new carriers. \n\n \n\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak\neconomic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage\nresellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,\nincluding staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.\nThe financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and\nmarketing of the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s Retail segment has required and will continue to require a\nsubstantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nretail stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require\nsubstantially more investment than the \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high fixed cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple\nstores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. \n\n \n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic\nfactors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel\npartners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a\nreasonable cost. \n\n \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business\nand present risks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business\nstrategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified\nissues not discovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and\noperating margin. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and\nmanufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. The Company\u0092s online\nservices may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or\nin the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u0092s business. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting\nits domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,\nreal estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. \n\n \n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could\ninclude, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of the device, locking the device to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of the device on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are\nalso subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in\nadditional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\n \n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of\ncompliance.\u00a0This increases the costs of doing business, and any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nregulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the Company\u0092s customers, delay the introduction\nof new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance\nthat the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of the\nCompany\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high\ndemand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are located. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances. \n\n\n\n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or\ndisruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s\nbusiness operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks, and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such\nevents could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays\nand inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services,\ngovernmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the\nCompany\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be\naffected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by\nnatural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the\nCompany\u0092s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u0092s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or\ncustomer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be subject to breaches of its information technology systems, which could damage business partner and customer\nrelationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, and could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information\n(\u0093PII\u0094). This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\npreferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company may be at a\nrelatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII managed. \n\n \n\nThe Company requires\nuser names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result\nof third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to Company data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce\nemployees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors\naccounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. \n\n \n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security.\nThe Company may experience a breach of its systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Company\u0092s reputation\nand brand could be materially damaged and use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease. The Company would also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding\ndata protection. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,\nretention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties\nwith which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or\nsignificant legal liability. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of\ndata are posted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection\nlaws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. \n\n \n\nThe Company is also\nsubject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the cost of\nassociated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase\nin payment card transaction costs. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software,\naccessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a\nresult of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nindirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted\nas a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, new products, component cost increases, strengthening U.S. dollar, or price competition. The Company has typically experienced higher net sales in the first fiscal quarter compared to\nother fiscal quarters due in part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions by the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. The\nCompany could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s\nlogistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology\nindustry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. The Company believes its\nstock price reflects high future growth and profitability expectations. If the Company fails to meet these expectations its stock price may significantly decline, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee\nretention. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S.\nand foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition\nregulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents\ncould nevertheless occur. \n\n \n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international\nactivities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability, and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s\nproducts in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including\nduties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit\nrisk and avoid losses. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to\nnon-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. For example, the uncertainty regarding the ability of certain European countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations and the related financial restructuring\nefforts by European governments may cause the value of several European currencies, including the euro, to fluctuate, which could adversely affect the Company\u0092s non-U.S. dollar sales and operating expenses in the impacted jurisdictions.\nWeakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially\nreducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the\nU.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated\nsales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the\nCompany\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange\nrates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market\nvalues of its investment portfolio. \n\n \n\nThe Company has not recognized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents\nand marketable securities, but could experience significant declines in the market value of its investment portfolio. Given the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of\nthese investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities could decline and result in a significant impairment. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its\ntrade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A\nsubstantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international\nmarkets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble\nfinal products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 29, 2012, a significant portion of the Company\u0092s trade\nreceivables were concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and\nlimit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. Results of legal proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and, regardless of the merit of the claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the\nCompany\u0092s operations, and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \n\n \n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary\ndamages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current\neconomic and political conditions make tax rates in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., subject to significant change. The Company\u0092s future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing\nstatutory \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ntax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by\nthe Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the\noutcome of these examinations. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Factors that might cause such differences include, but\nare not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors,\u0094 which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated\nfinancial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company\u0092s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to\nthe Company\u0092s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \u0093Company\u0094 and \u0093Apple\u0094 as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,\nunless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n \n\nExecutive Overview \n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets mobile\ncommunication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, peripherals, networking solutions, and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u0092s\nproducts and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the iOS and OS X operating systems, iCloud, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company also\nsells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales force, as well as through\nthird-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories\nthrough its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers. \n\n \n\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, and services. The Company\u0092s business strategy leverages its\nunique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software, and services to provide its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. As part of its\nstrategy, the Company continues to expand its platform for the discovery and delivery of third-party digital content and applications through the iTunes Store. As part of the iTunes Store, the Company\u0092s App Store and iBookstore allow customers\nto discover and download applications and books through either a Mac or Windows-based computer or through \u0093iOS devices,\u0094 namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. The Company\u0092s Mac App Store allows customers to easily discover, download and\ninstall Mac applications. The Company also supports a community for the development of third-party software and hardware products and digital content that complement the Company\u0092s offerings. The Company\u0092s strategy also includes expanding\nits distribution network to effectively reach more customers and provide them with a high-quality sales and post-sales support experience. \n\n \n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including the market for mobile communications and media devices with its iOS devices; personal computers with its Mac computers; portable\ndigital players with iPod; and distribution of third-party digital content and applications with the iTunes Store, App Store, iBookstore, and Mac App Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n25 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthe markets where it competes, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that continual investment in research and\ndevelopment and marketing and advertising is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies. The Company\u0092s research and development spending is focused on investing in new hardware and software products, and in\nfurther developing its existing products, including iPhone, iPad, Mac, and iPod hardware; iOS and OS X operating systems; and a variety of application software and online services. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company uses a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels, such as its retail stores, online stores, and direct sales\nforce, and third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of\nthe hardware and software integration, and demonstrate the unique solutions that are available on its products. The Company further believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an effective way to demonstrate the advantages of\nits products over those of its competitors and providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which\nservice and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution capabilities by expanding the number of its own retail stores worldwide. Additionally, the Company has invested in programs to enhance reseller sales\nby placing high quality Apple fixtures, merchandising materials and other resources within selected third-party reseller locations. Through the Apple Premium Reseller Program, certain third-party resellers focus on the Apple platform by providing a\nhigh level of integration and support services, and product expertise. \n\n \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u0094 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting\npolicies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the\nresults of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n\n\n\nManagement believes the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and\nimpairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the\nportrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting\npolicies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n \n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n\n \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals,\nand service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the\ncustomer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education\ncustomers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the\nsale of hardware products, \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n26 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nsoftware bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition\naccounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades\nand (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\n \n\nFor multi-element\narrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software, and/or undelivered non-software\nservices, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:\n(i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the\nCompany sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a\nstand-alone basis. \n\n \n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from\ntime to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE\nnor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software\nservices based on the Company\u0092s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to\nfour years. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves management\u0092s judgment and considers multiple\nfactors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. If the facts and circumstances underlying the factors considered change, including the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide\nnon-software services or the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided, or should future facts and circumstances lead the Company to consider additional factors, the Company\u0092s ESPs and the\nfuture rate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. \n\n \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes\nrevenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be\nreliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the\nCompany has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product\ntransitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually\nredeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company\nwould be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n\n\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n27 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nof tax, in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an\nother-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if\nany security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent\nto which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before\nrecovery of the its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security.\n\n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party\nproducts held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts,\nproduct life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand\nchanges. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record\nadditional write-downs, which would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires\ncomponents through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and\nsubstantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation\nfees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n \n\nWarranty\nCosts \n\n \n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is\nrecognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates\nits estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs\ndiffer from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax\nconsequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable\nincome in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nvaluation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical\nmerits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n\n\n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax\nplanning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not\nrealizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in\nestimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition and operating results. \n\n \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 7, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies,\u0094 the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including those that arise in the ordinary course of business. The\nCompany records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably\nestimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other\ncontingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these\nlegal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\n\n \n\nFiscal Period \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period\u00a0that ends on the last Saturday of September.\u00a0The Company\u0092s fiscal years 2012,\u00a02011 and 2010 ended on September\u00a029,\n2012,\u00a0September\u00a024, 2011,\u00a0and September\u00a025, 2010, respectively.\u00a0Fiscal year 2012\u00a0spanned 53 weeks, with a 14\n\nth\n\n week included in the first quarter of 2012, as is done approximately every six years to realign the Company\u0092s\nfiscal quarters more closely to calendar quarters.

The year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iPhone in all\nof the Company\u0092s operating segments, which is primarily a result of the launches of iPhone 4S in the first quarter of 2012 and iPhone 5 in the fourth quarter of 2012, ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS, and expanded distribution with\nnew carriers and resellers. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were 51% and 43% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPad and related products and services were $32.4 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $12.1 billion or 59% compared to 2011.\nUnit sales of iPad were 58.3\u00a0million during 2012, an increase of 80% from 2011. The year-over-year increase in iPad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for iPad in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments as a\nresult of the launch of the new iPad in March 2012, continued demand for iPad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. The year-over-year growth rate of iPad unit sales was higher than the growth rate of iPad net sales during 2012 due to a\nreduction of average selling prices as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced iPad models, the price reduction for iPad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through third-party resellers. Net sales of iPad\nand related products and services were 21% and 19% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales were $23.2 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 7% compared to 2011. Mac unit sales totaled 18.2\u00a0million\nduring 2012, representing an increase of 1.4\u00a0million or 9% compared to 2011. The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects increased demand for Mac portables in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments\ndriven by 2012 releases of updated models of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, including the new MacBook Pro with Retina display in June 2012. Partially offsetting the increase in net sales of Mac portables was a decline in net sales of Mac desktops that\nreflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012. Additionally, the Company did not introduce updated versions of its Mac desktop products in 2012. Mac net sales were 15% and 20% of the Company\u0092s total net\nsales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services were $8.5 billion in 2012, representing an increase of $2.2 billion or 35% compared to 2011.\nThe increase was due primarily to growth of the iTunes Store, which generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4\u00a0billion during 2011. The strong results of the iTunes Store reflect growth of the App Store;\ngrowth of the Company\u0092s customer base; and the continued expansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the iTunes Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content and applications offerings\naround the world. Net sales of other music related products and services were 5% and 6% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nPartially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales experienced\nacross all operating segments. iPod net sales were $5.6 billion in 2012, a decrease of $1.8\u00a0billion or 25% compared to 2011. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 17% in 2012 compared to 2011. Declines in net sales and unit sales of iPod\nreflect the continuing contraction of the overall market for MP3 players. Net sales of iPod were 4% and 7% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due\nin part to holiday seasonal demand. Actual and anticipated timing of new product introductions \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n31 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nby the Company can also significantly impact the level of net sales experienced by the Company in any particular quarter. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of\nproduct introductions should be considered reliable indicators of the Company\u0092s future net sales or financial performance. \n\n \n\nGrowth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. The net sales growth during the first six months of\n2012 reflects the launch of iPhone 4S in the first quarter of 2012 and the Company\u0092s ability to meet demand more quickly for iPhone 4S when compared to the iPhone 4 launch. Growth during the first half of 2012 was also favorably impacted by the\naddition of a 14\n\nth\n\n week in the first quarter of 2012 and\nstrong unit sales of iPad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in iPad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011. \n\n \n\nFiscal Year 2011 versus 2010 \n\n \n\nNet sales during 2011 increased $43.0\nbillion or 66% compared to 2010. Several factors contributed positively to this increase, including the following: \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPhone and related products and services were $47.1 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $21.9 billion or 87% compared to 2010.\niPhone unit sales totaled 72.3\u00a0million during 2011, representing an increase of 32.3\u00a0million units or 81% compared to 2010. iPhone year-over-year net sales growth reflected strong demand for iPhone 4 in all of the Company\u0092s operating\nsegments. The expanded U.S. distribution of iPhone to the Verizon Wireless network beginning in February 2011, continued expansion into new countries, and increased distribution with other new carriers and resellers also contributed to the\nyear-over-year growth of iPhone. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services accounted for 43% and 39% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of iPad and related products and services, which the Company introduced in the third quarter of 2010, were $20.4 billion in 2011,\nrepresenting an increase of $15.4 billion or 311% compared to 2010. Unit sales of iPad were 32.4\u00a0million during 2011, an increase of 334% from 2010. The year-over-year unit growth and net sales growth were driven by strong iPad demand in all of\nthe Company\u0092s operating segments. Net sales of iPad and related products and services accounted for 19% and 8% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales were $21.8 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $4.3 billion or 25% compared to 2010. Mac unit sales increased by\n3.1\u00a0million or 22% in 2011 compared to 2010. The year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales was due primarily to higher demand in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which were updated in\nJuly 2011 and February 2011, respectively. The year-over-year revenue growth for portables and desktops was 36% and 4%, respectively. Mac net sales accounted for 20% and 27% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0095\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales of other music related products and services were $6.3 billion in 2011, representing an increase of $1.4 billion or 28% compared to 2010.\nThe increase was due primarily to increased net sales from the iTunes Store, which was largely driven by App Store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the Company\u0092s geographic segments. During 2011, net\nsales for the iTunes Store, App Store and iBookstore was $5.4 billion, representing an increase of 33% compared to 2010. The Company believes this continued growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital\ncontent, continued growth in its customer base of iOS devices, expansion of third-party audio and video content available via the iTunes Store, and continued interest in and growth of the App Store. Net sales of other music related products and\nservices accounted for 6% and 8% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nPartially offsetting the positive factors contributing to the overall increase in net sales was a decrease in iPod net sales of $821\nmillion or 10% during 2011 compared to 2010. Similarly, iPod unit sales decreased by 15% in 2011 compared to 2010. However, net sales per iPod unit sold increased during 2011 compared to 2010 due primarily\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n32 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nto a shift in iPod product mix toward iPod touch.

The Company\u0092s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations. The results\nof the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific segments do not include results of the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa.\nThe Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13 countries, including the U.S. Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar\nservices. Further information regarding the Company\u0092s operating segments may be found in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 8, \u0093Segment Information and Geographic Data.\u0094\n\n\n \n\nAmericas \n\n\n\n\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased $19.2 billion or 50% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was\nprimarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, and higher sales from the iTunes Store. The Americas segment represented approximately 37% and 35% of the\nCompany\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased $13.8 billion or\n56% during 2011 compared to 2010. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales was a significant year-over-year increase in iPhone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4 and increased sales of iPad and Mac, partially\noffset by a decrease in iPod sales. Higher sales of third-party digital content and applications from the iTunes Store also drove an increase in net sales during 2011. The Americas segment represented approximately 35% and 37% of the Company\u0092s\ntotal net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n \n\nEurope \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased $8.5 billion or 31% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, higher\nsales from the iTunes Store and increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4S. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in\nnet sales in the Europe segment to the extent it did in other segments. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other geographic segments reflects growth in iPhone unit sales that was\nwell below the growth rates experienced by the Company\u0092s other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in iPad unit sales. Net sales in the Europe segment were also negatively impacted by the region\u0092s uncertain economic\nconditions and the strength in the U.S. dollar relative to several European currencies, including the euro. The Europe segment represented approximately 23% and 26% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n\n\n\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased $9.1 billion or 49% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in net sales during 2011 was\nattributable primarily to the continued year-over-year increase in iPhone sales from carrier expansion and strong demand for iPhone 4, and increased sales of iPad and Mac, partially offset by a decrease in iPod sales. The Europe segment represented\n26% and 29% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n33 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nJapan \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Japan segment increased $5.1 billion or 94% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of\niPhone 4S and iPhone 5, expanded distribution with a new iPhone carrier, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the iTunes Store, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The Japan segment represented\napproximately 7% and 5% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Japan segment\nincreased $1.5 billion or 37% during 2011 compared to 2010. The key contributors to Japan\u0092s net sales growth were increased iPhone sales, strong sales of iPad, increased sales of Mac, and strength in the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S.\ndollar. The Japan segment represented 5% and 6% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2011 and 2010, respectively. \n\n \n\nAsia-Pacific\n\n\n \n\nNet sales in the Asia-Pacific segment increased $10.7 billion or 47% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales\nduring 2012 was mainly due to increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4S, strong demand for the new iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac sales. Growth in the Asia Pacific segment was affected by the timing of iPhone and iPad product\nlaunches. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Asia Pacific segment during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was not launched in China during 2012, and the new iPad that was introduced by the Company in March 2012 was not\nlaunched in China until the fourth quarter of 2012. The Asia-Pacific segment represented approximately 21% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in both 2012 and 2011. \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased $14.3 billion or 174% during 2011 compared to 2010. The Company experienced particularly strong year-over-year net sales growth in its Asia Pacific segment\nduring 2011, especially in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan. Korea and Australia also experienced strong year-over-year revenue growth. Higher net sales in the Asia Pacific segment were due mainly to the increase in iPhone sales\nprimarily attributable to the strong demand for iPhone 4 and carrier expansion, strong sales of iPad, and increased Mac sales. The Asia Pacific segment represented 21% and 13% of the Company\u0092s total net sales in 2011 and 2010, respectively.\n\n\n \n\nRetail \n\n \n\nNet\nsales in the Retail segment increased $4.7 billion or 33% during 2012 compared to 2011. The growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iPhone following the launches of iPhone 4S and iPhone 5, strong demand for the\nnew iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac net sales. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Retail segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other segments reflects the significant growth in iPad indirect distribution channel\nexpansion.\u00a0The Retail segment accounted for 12% and 13% of the Company\u0092s total net sales for 2012 and 2011, respectively. \n\n \n\nThe Company opened 33 new retail stores during 2012, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 390 stores open compared to 357 stores at the end of 2011. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the\nCompany had a total of 250 U.S. retail stores and 140 international retail stores. With an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3\nmillion in 2011. \n\n \n\nNet sales in the Retail segment increased $4.3 billion or 44% during 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in\nnet sales was driven primarily by strong demand for iPad, higher Mac sales, and an increase in iPhone sales. The Company opened 40 new retail stores during 2011, 28 of which were outside the U.S., ending the year with 357\u00a0stores open compared\nto 317 stores at the end of 2010. As of September\u00a024, 2011, the Company had a total of 245 U.S. retail stores and 112 international retail stores. During 2011, the Company had an average of 326\u00a0stores compared to an average of 288 stores\nduring 2010.

This year-over-year increase in\ngross margin was largely driven by lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iPhone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S.\ndollar. The gross margin percentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. The primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iPhone\nsales and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. Additionally, gross margin in the second half\u00a0of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products\u00a0with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver\ngreater value to customers,\u00a0price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs. \n\n\n\n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2011 was 40.5%, compared to 39.4% in 2010. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven\nby lower commodity and other product costs. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects to experience decreases in its gross margin percentage in\nfuture periods, as compared to levels achieved during 2012, and the Company anticipates gross margin of about 36% during the first quarter of 2013. Expected future declines in gross margin are largely due to a higher mix of new and innovative\nproducts with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to customers and anticipated component cost and other cost increases. Future strengthening of the U.S. dollar could further negatively impact gross\nmargin. \n\n \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage in future periods, including\nthe first quarter of 2013, are forward-looking and could differ from actual results because of several factors including, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors\u0094\nand those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased\ncompetition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and potential increases in the cost of components, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix\ntowards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the\nCompany\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in\nthe short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n35 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,381\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,429\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,782\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,040\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n7,599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,517\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development (\u0093R&D\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nR&D expense increased $952 million or 39% in 2012 compared to 2011 and $647 million or 36% in 2011 compared to 2010. The growth in\nR&D expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. Although total R&D expense increased 39% and 36% in 2012 and 2011, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of\nnet sales. \n\n \n\nThe Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and\ncompetitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to\nremain competitive. \n\n \n\nSelling, General and Administrative (\u0093SG&A\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nSG&A expense increased $2.4 billion or 32% during 2012 compared to 2011 and $2.1 billion or 38% during 2011 compared to 2010. These\nincreases were primarily due to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment, increased headcount and related expenses, higher spending on professional services, marketing and advertising programs, and increased variable costs\nassociated with the overall growth of the Company\u0092s net sales. \n\n \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\n\n\n\nOther income and expense for 2012, 2011, and 2010 are as follows (in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a01,088\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0519\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0311\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther expense, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(566\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(104\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(156\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n522\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n415\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n155\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income and expense increased $107 million or 26% to $522 million during 2012 compared to\n$415\u00a0million and $155 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2012 was due primarily to higher interest and dividend income on the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The overall increase in other income and expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was attributable to higher interest income and net realized gains on\nsales of marketable securities. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%, 0.77%, and 0.75% during 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. During 2012, 2011, and 2010, the\nCompany had no debt outstanding and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\n \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates were approximately 25.2%, 24.2%, and 24.4% for 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. The\nCompany\u0092s effective rates for these periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n36 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. \n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax\ncredits of $4.0 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $14.9 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of\na valuation allowance. \n\n \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u0093IRS\u0094) has completed its field audit of the Company\u0092s\nfederal income tax returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the years 2007 through 2009. All IRS\naudit issues for years prior to 2004 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result\nfrom tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be\nrequired to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September\u00a029,\n2012,\u00a0September\u00a024, 2011, and September\u00a025, 2010 (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2010\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n121,251\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n81,570\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n51,011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAccounts receivable, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,930\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,369\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,510\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInventories\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n791\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n776\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,051\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking capital\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n19,111\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n17,018\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,956\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAnnual operating cash flow\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n50,856\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n37,529\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,595\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had $121.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities, an increase of $39.7 billion or 49% from September\u00a024, 2011. The principal components of this net increase was the cash generated by operating activities of $50.9 billion, which was partially offset by payments for acquisition of\nproperty, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion, payments for acquisition of intangible assets of $1.1 billion and payments of dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $2.5 billion. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy\ngenerally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. As of September\u00a029, 2012 and\nSeptember\u00a024, 2011, $82.6 billion and $54.3 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts\nheld by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital\nneeds, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments, common stock repurchases, dividends on its common stock, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\n\n\n\nCapital Assets \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s capital expenditures were $10.3 billion during 2012, consisting of $865 million for retail store facilities and $9.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nequipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\u0092s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2012 were $8.3 billion. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $10 billion for capital expenditures during 2013, including approximately $850 million\nfor retail store facilities and approximately $9.15 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software\nand enhancements. \n\n \n\nDuring 2013, the Company expects to open about 30 to 35 new retail stores, with approximately\nthree-quarters located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Program \n\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a dividend policy pursuant to which it plans to pay, subject to subsequent\ndeclaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. The Company expects to pay approximately $2.5 billion each quarter in conjunction with the quarterly declared dividends. \n\n \n\nIn March 2012, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is expected to be\nexecuted over a three-year period with the primary objective of neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity grants and employee stock purchase programs. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific\nnumber of shares. The Company anticipates that it will utilize approximately $45 billion of domestic cash to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and to remit withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units in the first three\nyears of the dividend and stock repurchase programs. The Company anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the repurchase program will come primarily from current domestic cash and from on-going U.S. operating activities and the cash\ngenerated from such activities. \n\n \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated\nretained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides\nfinancing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. \n\n \n\nThe following table presents certain payments due\nby the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September\u00a029, 2012 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Total\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue\u00a0\nin\n\nLess\n\nThan\n\n1\u00a0Year\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n1-3 Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue in\n\n4-5\nYears\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\nDue\u00a0\nin\n\nMore\n\nThan\n\n5\u00a0Years\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOperating leases\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,414\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n516\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,098\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n999\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,801\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPurchase obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21,053\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n21,053\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther obligations\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n988\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n937\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n26,455\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n22,506\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,147\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,001\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,801\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nLease Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for\nterms ranging from \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nfive to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under\nnoncancelable operating leases were $4.4 billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with\nOutsourcing Partners and Component Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture\nsub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically\ncovers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders,\nsupplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $21.1 billion.\n\n\n \n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $988 million as of September\u00a029, 2012, that were comprised mainly of commitments to\nacquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $13.8 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a029, 2012, the Company had gross\nunrecognized tax benefits of $2.1 billion and an additional $401 million for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in\nindividual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\n\n\n\nIndemnification \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include\nindemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant\npayments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to\nindemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of\nSeptember\u00a029, 2012 or September\u00a024, 2011. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance\nexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these\nagreements historically have not been material. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \n\n \n\nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management\nactivities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the\nrecognition timing of gains and losses related to these instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in\nU.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the\nCompany. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external\nmanager performance. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate\nrisk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel\nshift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a029, 2012, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\nportfolio. As of September\u00a024, 2011, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would result in a $913 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the\ninvestments prior to maturity. \n\n \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n \n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency\nexchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to\nprotect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\u0092s practice\nis to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting\nconsiderations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n40 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of\nthe Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of September\u00a029, 2012\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $161 million as of September\u00a024, 2011. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a029, 2012 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates,\nforeign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n41 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nThe\nfollowing discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II,\nItem\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData\u0094 of this Form 10-K. \n\n \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\n\n \n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global\nand regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in\nincome or asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s\nexpectations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include\nincreases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior.\nThese and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. \n\n \n\nIn\nthe event of further financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental\ntightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity, and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or\nfinancial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n9 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nfinance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the\nCompany\u0092s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restricting the Company\u0092s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on\ngains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash balances; volatility in foreign\nexchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the\nCompany\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n \n\nGlobal\nmarkets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and\nresulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and\nproduct advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete\nsuccessfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution\nfor its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications, and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in research and development. The Company currently holds a significant\nnumber of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low\ncost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u0092s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors\ninfringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces\nsubstantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a\nminority market share in the smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s product features and applications within their own\nproducts or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of\nthe Company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be\nable to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their\nindividual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to\nmaintain their functional and design advantages. \n\n \n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a\nminority market share in the personal computer market. This market is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces a significant number\nof competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products, and a larger installed \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n10 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncustomer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal\ncomputers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the\nCompany\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n\n\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and\ntransitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the\nCompany must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number\nof factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software\nfor new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new\nproducts may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added\nresellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small\nand mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. \n\n \n\nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone\ntypically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters\ninto with new carriers. \n\n \n\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak\neconomic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage\nresellers from investing resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales,\nincluding staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue.\nThe financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and\nmarketing of the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to\npurchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have\nbecome obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its\nsuppliers\u0092 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n11 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncarrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets\nexceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not\nincur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\n \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a\ncombination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with\nthe\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. \n\n\n\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing\nrisks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of\ncomponents, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u0092s suppliers, described in\n\u0093\n\nGlobal economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply\nshortages and price increases. \n\n \n\nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices\nand personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The\nCompany\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing\ncapacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the\nCompany\u0092s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are\nlocated outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a\nfew outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over\nproduction and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these\npartners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability.\nWhile the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners in Asia for final assembly of\nsubstantially all \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n12 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nof the Company\u0092s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition,\nmanufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,\nmilitary actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested in\nmanufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of\ncomponents and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and\noperating margin and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and\nservices that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended\noperation. The Company\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company\nwill be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses, and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable\nterms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through the iTunes\nStore. This includes the right to make available music, movies, TV shows and books currently available through the iTunes Store. The licensing arrangements with these third parties are short-term and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of\nthese arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the\nCompany to license their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of\ncontent at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms,\ncould have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nSome third-party\ndigital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the\nCompany will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights\nmanagement, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from \n\nthird-party\n\n software developers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u0092s products. If\nthird-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n13 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s\nproducts compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, continued growth of Mac sales, and the costs of developing\nsuch applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Company\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the\nCompany\u0092s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution\nchannel, the App Store. The absence of multiple distribution channels, which are available for competing platforms, may limit the availability and acceptance of third-party applications by the Company\u0092s customers, thereby causing developers to\nreduce or curtail development for the iOS platform. In addition, iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might\nnot successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the\nrelative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s products rather than its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for\nthe Company\u0092s iOS devices may suffer. \n\n \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may\nnot be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products include\nthird-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance\nthat the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from\nselling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. \n\n \n\nFor example, technology companies, including many of the\nCompany\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or\notherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with mobile communication and media\ndevice companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and\nbefore the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in Europe and Asia. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential\nor actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing\nagreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations,\nand distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \n\n \n\nIn management\u0092s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss\ncontingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. \n\n \n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary\ndamages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or\nin the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u0092s business. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting\nits domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection,\nreal estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign\nexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health, and safety. \n\n \n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could\ninclude, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution, and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are also\nsubject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in\nadditional testing requirements, product modifications, delays in product shipment dates, or preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\n \n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and\ndoing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the\nCompany\u0092s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with\napplicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies and procedures. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S.\nand foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n15 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nenvironmental laws, labor laws, and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to\ncomply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. \n\n \n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other\ncosts, and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade\nregulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can\neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s Retail segment has required and will continue to\nrequire a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space.\nCertain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores\nrequire substantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Retail segment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could\nresult in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. \n\n \n\nMany\nfactors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on\ngeneral retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\u0092s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail channel partners, more challenging\nenvironments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\u0092s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable\ncost. \n\n \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present\nrisks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital, and unidentified issues not\ndiscovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters,\naccidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u0092s\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u0092s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and\nresult in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n16 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThere may be breaches of the Company\u0092s information technology systems that\nmaterially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable\ninformation (\u0093PII\u0094). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers, and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access\nto PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and\nauthentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance,\nfaulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the\nCompany\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of\ncustomer orders. \n\n \n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption, and other security measures\nto protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage\nbusiness partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII,\nthe Company\u0092s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding\ndata protection. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use,\nretention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties\nwith which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction\nto jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal\nliability. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s privacy policy and related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data are posted on\nits website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and\nregulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. \n\n \n\nThe Company is also subject\nto payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and\npenalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card\ntransaction costs. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n17 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of\nkey personnel. \n\n \n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key\npersonnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are located. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business may be impacted by political\nevents, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other circumstances. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical\nuncertainties, public health issues, and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers,\nlogistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents,\nterrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and\ndeliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the\nCompany could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and\ndisruptions in the operations of the Company\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical\nbusiness operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial\nrecovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly\nrevenue and operating results to fluctuate. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary across its products and distribution\nchannels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product\nlines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its\nindirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or\nchannel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday\ndemand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. The Company could be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the\nCompany\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock continues to experience substantial price volatility. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry, and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and\nvolume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock\nto exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price reflects \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n18 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nexpectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its\ncurrent share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors, and the Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of\nshares. If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact\non investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated\nwith changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in\nforeign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign\ncurrency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales\nof products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise\nlocal prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments,\nthereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in\nplace. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\n\n\n \n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and\npricing of the Company\u0092s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s\ncash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could\nresult in a significant realized loss. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor\nnon-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade\nreceivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited.\nThe Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has\nmade prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a028, 2013, a significant portion of the Company\u0092s trade receivables was\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n19 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nconcentrated within cellular network carriers, and its non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located\nprimarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its\ncredit risk and avoid losses. \n\n \n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or\ninternational tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u0092s\nfuture effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation,\nincluding in the U.S. and Ireland. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u0092s effective tax rates were to increase,\nparticularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u0092s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u0092s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be\nadversely affected. \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores, and\ndirect sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including\napplication software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and government customers. \n\n\n\n\nFiscal 2013 Highlights \n\n \n\nNet sales rose 9% or $14.4 billion during 2013 compared to 2012. This resulted from growth in net sales of iPhone; iTunes, software, and services; and iPad. Growth in 2013 reflects strong sales of iPhone\n5, strong continuing sales of iPhone 4 and 4s, the introduction of iPhone 5c and 5s, strong performance of the iPad Mini and fourth generation iPad, and continued growth in the Company\u0092s online sales of apps, digital content, and services.\nGrowth in these areas was partially offset by declines in net sales of Mac and iPod. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced increased net sales in 2013, with net sales growth being particularly strong in the Americas, Greater China\nand Japan operating segments. Similar to 2012, growth in total net sales was higher during the first half of 2013, rising $12.6 billion or 14.7% over the same period in 2012. First half growth in 2013 was driven by iPhone and iPad introductions at\nor near the beginning of 2013. \n\n \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2013, the Company introduced the fourth generation iPad and iPad\nMini, a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a new iPod touch, a new iMac, and expanded the rollout of iPhone 5 which began in September 2012. In June 2013 at its Worldwide Developer Conference, the Company announced iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks,\nannounced iTunes Radio, introduced a significant upgrade to MacBook Air, and provided a preview of all new Mac Pro desktops expected to be introduced during 2014. In September 2013, the Company introduced iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c, released iOS 7,\nlaunched iTunes Radio, and announced that beginning in September 2013 iPhoto, iMovie and iWork apps for iOS would be available as free downloads with all new \u0093iOS devices,\u0094 namely iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. In October 2013, the Company\nannounced iPad Air\u0099, its fifth generation iPad, and iPad mini with Retina display. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n25 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2013 the Company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital\nto shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to utilize for the program through December 2015 to $100 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $3.05 per\ncommon share beginning in May 2013. During 2013, the Company utilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $11.40 per common share. In conjunction with its capital return program, in May 2013 the Company\nissued $17.0 billion of notes with varying maturities through 2043. \n\n \n\nFiscal 2012 Highlights \n\n\n\n\nOverall net sales during 2012 increased $48.3 billion or 45% compared to 2011. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced\nincreased net sales during 2012, primarily a result of strong demand for iPhone and iPad. Growth in total net sales was particularly strong during the first six months of 2012, rising $34.1 billion or 66% compared to the same period in 2011. The net\nsales growth during the first six months of 2012 reflected the launch of iPhone 4s in the first quarter of 2012 and the Company\u0092s ability to meet demand more quickly for iPhone 4s when compared to the iPhone 4 launch. Growth during the first\nhalf of 2012 was also favorably impacted by strong unit sales of iPad during the holiday season, resulting in a 111% increase in iPad unit sales during the first quarter of 2012 compared to the same quarter in 2011. Partially offsetting these\npositive factors was a decrease in iPod net sales experienced across all operating segments. \n\n \n\nIn October 2011, the Company\nintroduced iPhone 4s and launched iCloud, the Company\u0092s cloud service that stores user data and keeps it up to date and available on multiple iOS devices and Mac and Windows personal computers. The Company introduced the third generation iPad\nwith Retina display in March 2012 and in June 2012 introduced the MacBook Pro with Retina display and an updated MacBook Air During the fourth quarter of 2012, OS X Mountain Lion was released and iPhone 5 was introduced. \n\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, the Company announced a $10 billion share repurchase program that would be executed over three years and announced plans\nto initiate a quarterly dividend commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012. During the fourth quarter, the Company paid dividends of $2.5 billion or $2.65 per common share. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n26 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nSales Data \n\n \n\nThe

All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced increases in net sales and unit\nsales of iPhone during 2013 compared to 2012. The year-over-year impact of higher iPhone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iPhone average selling prices (\u0093ASPs\u0094) in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily as a result of a\nshift in product mix towards lower-priced iPhone models, particularly iPhone 4. All of the Company\u0092s geographic operating segments experienced a decline in iPhone ASPs during 2013. \n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2012 reflects strong demand for iPhone in all of the Company\u0092s\noperating segments, except for the Rest of Asia Pacific segment.

This growth was driven by the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year growth rate of total iPad unit sales was significantly higher than\nthe growth rate of total iPad net sales for 2013 due to a reduction in iPad ASPs of 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. This decline resulted primarily from introduction of the lower priced iPad mini and the full year impact of the price reduction on iPad\n2 made in 2012. The decline in iPad ASPs was experienced to various degrees by all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. \n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year increase in iPad net sales and unit sales during 2012 was driven by strong demand for iPad in all of the\nCompany\u0092s operating segments as a result of the launch of the third generation iPad in March 2012, continued demand for iPad 2, and expanded distribution with new resellers. The year-over-year growth rate of iPad unit sales was higher than the\ngrowth rate of iPad net sales during 2012 due to a 10% reduction in ASPs as a result of a shift in product mix toward lower-priced iPad models, a price reduction on iPad 2 and an increase in indirect sales due to expanded distribution through\nthird-party resellers. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n28 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nMac \n\n \n\nThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (net sales in millions and units in thousands): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n21,483\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(7)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n23,221\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n21,783\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnit sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,341\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(10)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18,158\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,735\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nMac net sales and unit sales for 2013 were down or relatively flat in all of the Company\u0092s operating\nsegments.

Partially offsetting the increase in net sales of Mac portables was a decline in net\nsales of Mac desktops that reflected the overall decline in the market for desktop personal computers during 2012.

The iTunes Store generated a total of $9.3 billion in net sales during 2013, a 24% increase from 2012. Growth in the iTunes Store, which includes the App Store, the Mac App Store\nand the iBooks Store, reflects continued growth in the installed base of iOS devices, expanded offerings of iOS apps and related in-App purchases, and expanded offerings of iTunes digital content. \n\n\n\n\nThe increase in net sales of iTunes, software and services in 2012 compared to 2011 was due primarily to growth of the iTunes Store,\nwhich generated total net sales of $7.5 billion for 2012 compared to net sales of $5.4 billion during 2011. The strong results of the iTunes Store in 2012 reflect growth of the App Store; growth of the Company\u0092s customer base; and the continued\nexpansion of third-party audio, video and book content available for sale or rent via the iTunes Store. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n29 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\n\n\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

These increases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Mac and iPod and a decline in iPad ASPs. Net sales in the Europe segment continue to be negatively\nimpacted by unfavorable economic conditions in parts of the region reflected by second half 2013 net sales falling 4% compared to the second half of 2012, which followed an 11% increase in net sales during the first half of 2013. \n\n\n\n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was primarily driven by strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, higher sales from the\niTunes Store and increased demand for iPhone from the launch of iPhone 4s. iPhone 5 was launched in a limited number of countries in the Europe segment at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and did not contribute to the growth in net sales in the\nEurope segment to the extent it did in other segments. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Europe segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other geographic segments reflects growth in iPhone unit sales that was well below the\ngrowth rates experienced by the Company\u0092s other operating segments, partially offset by strong growth in iPad unit sales.

With an average of 403 and 365 open stores during 2013 and 2012, respectively, average revenue per store decreased to $50.2 million in 2013, compared\nto $51.5 million in 2012. \n\n \n\nThe growth in net sales during 2012 was driven primarily by increased demand for iPhone following\nthe launches of iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, strong demand for the third generation iPad and iPad 2, and higher Mac net sales. Lower year-over-year growth in net sales in the Retail segment during 2012 compared to the Company\u0092s other segments\nreflects the significant growth in iPad indirect distribution channel expansion. With an average of 365 stores and 326 stores during 2012 and 2011, respectively, average revenue per store increased 19% to $51.5 million in 2012 compared to $43.3\nmillion in 2011. \n\n \n\nThe Retail segment\u0092s operating income was $4.0 billion, $4.6 billion and $3.1 billion during 2013,\n2012, and 2011, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in Retail operating income in 2013 is primarily attributable to lower gross margin similar to that experienced by the Company overall, partially offset by higher net sales. The year-over-year\nincrease in Retail operating income in 2012 is primarily attributable to higher overall net sales that resulted in significantly higher average revenue per store during 2012. \n\n \n\nGross Margin \n\n \n\nGross margin for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in\nmillions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n170,910\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n156,508\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n108,249\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCost of sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n106,606\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n87,846\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n64,431\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n64,304\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n68,662\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n43,818\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGross margin percentage\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n37.6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n43.9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n40.5%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2013 was 37.6% compared to 43.9% in 2012. The year-over-year decrease in\ngross margin in 2013 compared to 2012 was driven by multiple factors including introduction of new versions of existing products with higher cost structures and flat or reduced pricing; a shift in sales mix to products with lower margins;\nintroduction of iPad mini with gross margin significantly below the Company\u0092s average product margins; higher expenses associated with changes to certain of the Company\u0092s service policies and other\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n32 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nwarranty costs; price reductions on certain products, including iPad 2 and iPhone 4; and unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. \n\n\n\n\nThe gross margin percentage in 2012 was 43.9%, compared to 40.5% in 2011. This year-over-year increase in gross margin was largely driven\nby lower commodity and other product costs, a higher mix of iPhone sales, and improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. The increase in gross margin was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The gross margin\npercentage during the first half of 2012 was 45.9% compared to 41.4% during the second half of 2012. The primary drivers of higher gross margin in the first half of 2012 compared to the second half are a higher mix of iPhone sales and improved\nleverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. Additionally, gross margin in the second half\u00a0of 2012 was also affected by the introduction of new products with flat pricing that have higher cost structures and deliver greater value to\ncustomers,\u00a0price reductions on certain existing products, higher transition costs associated with product launches, and continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar; partially offset by lower commodity costs. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of 2014 to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. The foregoing statement regarding\nthe Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2014 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u0092s future gross margin can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to those\nset forth above in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and those described in this paragraph. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety\nof factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins.\n\n \n\nIn response to competitive pressures, the Company expects\nit will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for\ncertain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as\nfollows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,475\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,381\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n39%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n2,429\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,830\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,040\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n7,599\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n15,305\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,421\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n34%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,028\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development (\u0093R&D\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nThe growth in R&D expense was driven by an increase in headcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. Although\ntotal R&D expense increased 32% and 39% in 2013 and 2012, respectively, it remained fairly consistent as a percentage of net sales. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and\ncompetitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to\nremain competitive. \n\n \n\nSelling, General and Administrative (\u0093SG&A\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nThe growth in SG&A during 2013 was primarily due to the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment and increased\nheadcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n33 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nservices.

The overall increase in other income and expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was attributable to higher interest and dividend income on the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities balances, partially offset by higher premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.03%\nduring 2013 and 2012 and 0.77% during 2011. The Company had no debt outstanding during 2012 and 2011 and accordingly did not incur any related interest expense. \n\n \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n \n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax\nrates for 2013, 2012 and 2011 are as follows (in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2011\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,118\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n14,030\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a08,283\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n26.2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n25.2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24.2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates for all periods differ from the statutory federal income tax rate\nof 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested\noutside the U.S. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary\ndifferences, tax losses, and tax credits of $4.2 billion, and deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion.

The Company anticipates the cash used for future\ndividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a028, 2013 and September\u00a029, 2012, $111.3 billion and $82.6 billion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign\nsubsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. \n\ndollar-denominated\n\n holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company\u0092s\nmarketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade\nwith the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n \n\nDuring 2013, cash generated from operating activities\nof $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion\nduring 2013 consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and maturities of marketable securities of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2013 consisted\nprimarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion. \n\n\n\n\nDuring 2012, cash generated from operating activities of $50.9 billion was a result of $41.7 billion of net income and non-cash\nadjustments to net income of $9.4 billion, partially offset by a decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $299 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2012 of $48.2 billion consisted primarily of net purchases, sales and\nmaturities of marketable securities of $38.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.3 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2012 of $1.7 billion consisted primarily of cash used to pay dividends and dividend\nequivalent rights of $2.5 billion. \n\n \n\nCapital Assets \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s capital expenditures were $7.0 billion during 2013, consisting of $499 million for retail store facilities and $6.5\nbillion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\u0092s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2013 were $8.2 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n35 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $11.0 billion for capital expenditures\nduring 2014, including approximately $550 million for retail store facilities and approximately $10.5 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and corporate facilities and infrastructure,\nincluding information systems hardware, software and enhancements. \n\n \n\nDuring 2014, the Company expects to open about 30 new\nretail stores, with approximately two-thirds located outside of the U.S. During 2014, the Company also expects to remodel approximately 20 of its existing stores. \n\n \n\nLong-Term Debt \n\n \n\nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0\nbillion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To manage the risk of adverse fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate\nnotional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate notes. Of the aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion, $2.5 billion is due in 2016 and $14.5 billion is due in 2018 through 2043. \n\n\n\n\nDividend and Stock Repurchase Program \n\n \n\nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company raised its cash dividend by 15% to $3.05 per common share. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly dividends of $3.05 per common share each quarter,\nsubject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\n \n\nIn 2012, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors authorized a program to\nrepurchase up to $10 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock. In April 2013, the Company\u0092s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been utilized as\nof September\u00a028, 2013. The share repurchase program is expected to be completed by December 2015. The Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be\nrepurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. \n\n \n\nBeginning in August 2012 through December 2015, the Company anticipates it will utilize approximately $100 billion to pay dividends and dividend equivalent rights, repurchase shares, and remit withheld\ntaxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units, of which $37.1 billion had been utilized through September\u00a028, 2013.

\n\nLease Commitments \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are for\nterms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases\nwere $4.7 billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments with Outsourcing\nPartners and Component Suppliers \n\n \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the\nCompany\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150\ndays. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and\nopen orders based on projected demand information. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the\nCompany had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $18.6 billion. \n\n \n\nOther Obligations \n\n \n\nIn addition to the off-balance sheet commitments\nmentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of September\u00a028, 2013, that consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments\nrelated to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company\nhad non-current deferred tax liabilities of $16.5 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a028, 2013, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $2.7 billion and an additional $590 million for gross interest and penalties classified as\nnon-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above\ncontractual obligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnification \n\n \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other\nagreements entered into by \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n37 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an\nindemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a\nreasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not\nrecord a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September\u00a028, 2013 or September\u00a029, 2012. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company\nhas agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal\nproceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances\ninvolved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments made under these agreements historically have not been material. \n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its\nfinancial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u0094 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated\nfinancial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values\nof assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n \n\nManagement\nbelieves the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated\npurchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and\noperating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and\nFinance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n\n\n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and\nsupport contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it\nhas been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the\nU.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware\nproducts, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware, and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n38 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nCompany recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products,\n(ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\n \n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware\nproduct\u0092s essential software, and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price\nto be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price\n(\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of\nelements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\n \n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac\nand Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS\ndevices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the\nunspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided\nfor each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves\nmanagement\u0092s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u0092s ESPs and the future\nrate of related amortization for software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified\nsoftware upgrade rights, the estimated or actual costs incurred to provide non-software services, and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs.\nFor transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been\nmet. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the\nestimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the\nCompany\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive\nprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a\ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n\n\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated\nother comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n39 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nimpact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by\nspecific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the\nperiod any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes\nthereto; and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s assessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily\nimpaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. \n\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing\nprocess equipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The\nCompany records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed\nreview of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets\nand inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the\namount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. \n\n \n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are\nsubject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or\nmanufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u0092s product\ndevelopment plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company\u0092s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u0092s manufacturing process equipment\nor to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company\u0092s results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company records accruals for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be\ncancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are\napplied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days.\nIf there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products, if the Company\u0092s product development plans change, or if there is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the\nCompany\u0092s products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n\n\n\nWarranty Costs \n\n \n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and\nknowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n40 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\nthese estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as\nnecessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes tax\nbenefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial\nstatements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing\ntaxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to\nthe valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP\nand complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\n \n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in\nNote 10, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies,\u0094 the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and\nthe amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility\nthe Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company\nis subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of\nmanagement\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n41 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management \n\n \n\nThe Company regularly\nreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a \n\nstand-alone\n\n basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given\nthe effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in\neither foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely\naffect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n\n\n\nInvestments \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income is most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S.\ninterest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the\nCompany. A portion of the Company\u0092s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\u0092s investment policy and to objective market benchmarks. The Company\u0092s internal portfolio is benchmarked against external\nmanager performance. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s\ninvestment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the\nprimary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate\nrisk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel\nshift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a028, 2013, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the\nportfolio. As of September\u00a029, 2012, a similar 100 basis point increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company\nsold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n \n\nLong-Term Debt \n\n\n\n\nIn the third quarter of 2013, the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt, which included $3.0 billion of floating-rate notes. To\nmanage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which, in effect, fixed the interest rate of the floating-rate\nnotes. \n\n \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n \n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n42 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\ncurrency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange\nrisks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a portion of its material\nforeign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic\ncost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain\nof the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency\nderivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm\ncommitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of\nSeptember\u00a028, 2013 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $200 million as of September\u00a029, 2012. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments\nare generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future gains and losses associated\nwith the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a028, 2013 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n43 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These\nrisk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations\u0094 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u0094 of this Form 10-K. \n\n\n\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown,\nincluding but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause the Company\u0092s actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results\nof operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u0092s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. \n\n\n\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, past financial\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n\n\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional\neconomic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or\nasset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations\nas a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or\nregional demand include increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer\nspending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. \n\n \n\nIn the\nevent of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in\nthe credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or financial instability\nof outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to\nfinance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u0092s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Company\u0092s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially\nfrom expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; interest rates;\u00a0cash\nbalances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in\nthe\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject\nto rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and\nservices compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards,\ncontinual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new\nproducts and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related\nservices. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service\nmarks. In contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u0092s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property.\nIf the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\nadversely affected. \n\n \n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets\nrelated third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software\nand digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the\nCompany\u0092s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways\nto obtain third-party digital content and applications and with business models that include content provided to users for free. Some of the Company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the\nCompany. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects\ncompetition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u0092s financial condition\nand operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been\ncontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product\nlines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers\nhave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the\nCompany\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage\nfrequent product introductions and transitions. \n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company\ncompetes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions\ndepends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of\napplication software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated\ndemand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers, and value-added resellers, many of\nwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers, and consumers and small and mid-sized\nbusinesses through its online and retail stores. \n\n \n\nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of\nthe device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\n\n\n\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. Some resellers have perceived the\nexpansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from investing resources in the distribution and\nsale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with\nCompany employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could\nweaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for the Company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and\naccrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment\nwhenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds\nits fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur\nadditional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts\nand open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically\ncover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast\nincorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in\nsufficient quantities. \n\n \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for\nthe supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to\nbusiness failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u0092s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. The follow-on effects from global economic conditions on\u00a0the\nCompany\u0092s suppliers, described in \u0093\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company\nremains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. \n\n \n\nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile\ncommunication and media devices and personal computers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of\nthese industries. The Company\u0092s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured\nor manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to\nmeet the Company\u0092s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of whom are\nlocated outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing\npartners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s direct control over production and\ndistribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may\ncontain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the\nCompany relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u0092s\nhardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations\nmay be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or\npolitical issues. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has\nmade prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial\nproblems or other disruptions in their business, the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system\nsoftware and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u0092s intended operation. The Company\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages,\nservice slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it\nsells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the\nCompany on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content through\nthe iTunes Store. This includes the right to make available music, movies, TV shows and books currently available through the iTunes Store. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and\ndo not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to\nmake it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such\ncontent. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital\ncontent, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change,\nthe Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries\nhave passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the\nCompany\u0092s content providers. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from\n\n\nthird-party\n\n software developers. \n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware\nproducts depend in part on the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\nservices for the Company\u0092s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and\nservices depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based\non factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority\nshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to\ndeveloping and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and\ndevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose\nnot to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these\napplications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing software for the Company\u0092s iOS devices rather than its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts\non these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s iOS devices may suffer. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nrelies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\n\n\n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience\nand industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use\nthird-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition\nand operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found\nto have infringed on intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been\nfully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. \n\n \n\nFor example, technology\ncompanies, including many of the Company\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize\npatents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products compete with\nmobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a\nnumber of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual\nlitigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to\npay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. \n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses\ncan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u0092s operations and distracting to\nmanagement. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \n\n \n\nIn management\u0092s opinion,\nthere is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property\nrights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. \n\n \n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if\none or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely\naffected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially\nadversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to\nwhich could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u0092s business. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nis subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor,\nadvertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and\nexport requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many\njurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u0092s network, or\nmandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their\nnetworks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain\nproducts.\n\n \n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from\njurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the\naggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the Company\u0092s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has\nimplemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the\nCompany\u0092s policies and procedures. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws\nand regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations,\nincreases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents could\nnevertheless occur. \n\n \n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not\nlimited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from\nforeign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers\nin certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and\npersonnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales\nand marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Retail\nsegment, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements, and severance costs. \n\n\n\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and\nuncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the\nCompany\u0092s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and\nthe Company\u0092s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing\nbusiness and present risks not originally contemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or\nacquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not\ndiscovered in the Company\u0092s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s\nbusiness and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to\ninformation technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or\nother events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u0092s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to the Company\u0092s\nonline stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of\nonline services, transactions processing and financial reporting. \n\n \n\nThere may be breaches of the Company\u0092s information technology\nsystems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational\nconsequences. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable\ninformation (\u0093PII\u0094). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to\nPII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication\ntechnologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty\npassword management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the\nCompany\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of\ncustomer orders. \n\n \n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems\nand data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer\nrelationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Company\u0092s reputation\nand brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that,\nsubject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise\nin the continually evolving area of cyber risk. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules,\npolicies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the\ncollection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries\nand other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in penalties or\nsignificant legal liability. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s privacy policy, which includes related practices concerning the use and disclosure of data, is\nposted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and\nregulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. \n\n \n\nThe Company is also subject to payment card\nassociation rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In\naddition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. \n\n\n\n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer,\nexecutive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are\nlocated. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and\nother business interruptions. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused\nand could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.\nThe Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile\nacts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers,\nincluding channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected\nby more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the\nCompany\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component\nsuppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant\nexpenditures in order to resume operations. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support\ncontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and\nconfiguration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross\nmargin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition,\nor the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. \n\n \n\nThe Company has typically\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. The Company could\nbe subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s logistics,\ncomponents supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the\nCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Price\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price reflects expectations of future growth and\nprofitability. The Company also believes its stock price reflects expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to\ndeclaration by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors, and the Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet any of these expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local\ncurrencies. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar denominated sales\nand operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies\nmay also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nuses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 18\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment\nportfolio. \n\n \n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing\nof the Company\u0092s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a\nsignificant realized loss. \n\n \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and\nprepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n \n\nThe Company\ndistributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government\ncustomers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade\nreceivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other\nvendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a027, 2014, a\nsignificant portion of the Company\u0092s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual\nvendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will\neffectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n \n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S.\nor international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign\njurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u0092s future effective\ntax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and\nIreland. For example, in June 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Ireland with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company\u0092s Irish\nsubsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If the European Commission were to take a final decision against Ireland, it could require changes to existing tax rulings that, in turn, could increase the Company\u0092s taxes in the\nfuture. The European Commission could also require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes reflective of the disallowed state aid. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from\nthese examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u0092s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the\nultimate determination of the Company\u0092s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u0092s operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\n\n\n\nOverview and Highlights \n\n \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and\nmarkets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers and portable digital music players, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\nsells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of\nthird-party iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod compatible products, including application software, and various accessories through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumers; small and mid-sized businesses; and education, enterprise and\ngovernment customers. \n\n \n\nFiscal 2014 Highlights \n\n \n\nNet sales\nrose 7% or $11.9 billion during 2014 compared to 2013. This was driven by increases in net sales of iPhone; Mac; iTunes, Software and Services; and Accessories. Net sales and unit sales increased for iPhone primarily due to the successful\nintroduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and expanded distribution. Mac net sales and unit sales increased primarily due to\nstrong demand for MacBook Air and MacBook Pro which were updated in 2014 with faster processors and offered at lower prices. Net sales of iTunes, Software and Services grew primarily due to increased revenue from sales through the App Store,\nAppleCare and licensing. Net sales and unit sales for iPad declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due to lower unit sales in many markets. Growth in total net sales during 2014 was also negatively impacted by the continuing decline of iPod sales. All of\nthe Company\u0092s operating segments other than the Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced increased net sales in 2014, with growth being strongest in the Greater China and Japan operating segments. \n\n\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2014, the Company introduced iPad Air, its fifth generation iPad and iPad mini with Retina display. At its Worldwide\nDeveloper Conference in June 2014, the Company announced iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite. In September 2014, the Company introduced iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, released iOS 8, announced Apple Pay, which became available in the U.S. in October 2014, and previewed\nApple Watch, which is expected to be available in early calendar 2015. In October 2014, the Company introduced iPad Air 2, iPad mini 3, iMac with Retina 5K Display and an updated Mac mini; and released OS X Yosemite. \n\n\n\n\nDuring 2014, the Company completed various business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming\nmusic service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats headphones, speakers and audio software. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Company increased its share repurchase authorization to $90 billion and the quarterly\ndividend was raised to $0.47 per common share, resulting in an overall increase in its capital return program from $100\u00a0billion to over $130 billion. During 2014, the Company utilized $45 billion to repurchase its common stock and paid\ndividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion. The current share repurchase program is expected to be completed by the end of December 2015. The Company also issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt during 2014 with varying maturities through\n2044 and launched a commercial paper program, with $6.3 billion outstanding as of September\u00a027, 2014. \n\n \n\nFiscal 2013 Highlights \n\n\n\n\nNet sales rose 9% or $14.4 billion during 2013 compared to 2012. This resulted from growth in net sales of iPhone; iTunes, Software and Services; and\niPad. Growth in 2013 reflected strong sales of iPhone 5, strong continuing sales of iPhone 4 and 4s, the introduction of iPhone 5c and 5s, strong performance of the iPad mini and fourth generation iPad, and continued growth in the Company\u0092s\nonline sales of apps, digital content and services. Growth in these areas was partially offset by declines in net sales of Mac and iPod. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced increased net sales in 2013, with net sales growth\nbeing particularly strong in the Americas, Greater China and Japan operating segments. Growth in total net sales was higher during the first half of 2013, rising $12.6 billion or 14.7% over the same period in 2012. First half growth in 2013 was\ndriven by iPhone and iPad introductions at or near the beginning of 2013. \n\n \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2013, the Company introduced the fourth\ngeneration iPad and iPad mini, a new MacBook Pro with Retina display, a new iPod touch, a new iMac, and expanded the rollout of iPhone 5 which began in September 2012. In June 2013 at its Worldwide Developer Conference, the Company announced iOS 7\nand OS X Mavericks, announced iTunes Radio, introduced a significant upgrade to MacBook Air, and provided a preview of all new Mac Pro desktops that were introduced during 2014. In September 2013, the Company introduced iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c,\nreleased iOS 7, launched iTunes Radio, and announced that beginning in September 2013 iPhoto, iMovie and iWork Apps for iOS would be available as free downloads with all new iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices (\u0093iOS devices\u0094). \n\n\n\n\nIn April 2013, the Company announced a significant increase to its program to return capital to shareholders by raising the total amount it expected to\nutilize for the program through December 2015 to $100 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $60 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.44 per common share beginning in May 2013. During 2013, the Company\nutilized $23.0 billion to repurchase common shares and paid dividends of $10.5 billion or $1.64 per common share. In conjunction with its capital return program, in May 2013 the Company issued $17.0 billion of long-term debt with varying maturities\nthrough 2043. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form

Overall average selling prices (\u0093ASPs\u0094) for iPhone were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013, with growth in ASPs in the Americas and Retail segments being offset by a decline in\nASPs in the Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments. \n\n \n\nThe growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2013 resulted from\nincreased demand for iPhone in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments primarily due to the launch of iPhone 5 beginning in September 2012 and strong ongoing demand for iPhone 4 and 4s. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments experienced\nincreases in net sales and unit sales of iPhone during 2013 compared to 2012. The year-over-year impact of higher iPhone unit sales in 2013 was partially offset by a 3% decline in iPhone ASPs primarily as a result of a shift in product mix towards\nlower-priced iPhone models, particularly iPhone 4. All of the Company\u0092s geographic operating segments experienced a decline in iPhone ASPs during 2013. \n\n \n\niPad\n\n\n \n\nThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n30,283\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(5\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n31,980\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n30,945\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnit sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a067,977\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(4\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a071,033\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n22%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a058,310\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales and unit sales for iPad declined in 2014 compared to 2013. iPad net sales and unit sales grew in the Greater\nChina and Japan segments but this growth was more than offset by a decline in all other segments. Overall iPad ASPs were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 with a shift in mix to higher-priced iPads being offset by the October 2013 price\nreduction of iPad mini. ASPs increased in the Japan and Retail segments but were flat to slightly down in other segments. \n\n \n\nThe growth in net sales\nand unit sales of iPad during 2013 resulted from growth in iPad unit sales in all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. This growth was driven by the launch of iPad mini and the fourth generation iPad beginning in the first quarter of 2013. The\nyear-over-year growth rate of total iPad unit sales was significantly higher than the growth rate of total iPad net sales for 2013 due to a reduction in iPad ASPs of 15% in 2013 compared to 2012. This decline resulted primarily from introduction of\nthe lower priced iPad mini and the full year impact of the price reduction on iPad 2 made in 2012. The decline in iPad ASPs was experienced to various degrees by all of the Company\u0092s operating segments. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nMac \n\n \n\nThe following\ntable presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n24,079\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n21,483\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(7\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n23,221\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n15%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnit sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18,906\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,341\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(10\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18,158\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales for 2014 was primarily driven by increased sales of MacBook\nAir, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro.

These positive factors were partially offset by declines in ASPs for iPhone and iPad and by weakness in the Japanese Yen relative\nto the U.S. dollar. \n\n \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\n \n\nThe following\ntable presents Rest of Asia Pacific net sales information for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (dollars in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,344\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(7\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n11,181\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,741\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales in the Rest of Asia Pacific segment declined in 2014 compared to 2013 due to year-over-year reductions in net\nsales in all major product categories except Mac and reductions in unit sales of iPad and iPod.

The\nforegoing statement regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2015 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u0092s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors\nincluding, but not limited to those set forth above in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward\npressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components and potential\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures,\nthe Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to\nstimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n\n\n\nOperating Expenses \n\n \n\nOperating expenses for 2014, 2013 and 2012\nare as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n6,041\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,475\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n32%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n3,381\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n11,993\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,830\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n8%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,040\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,034\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n15,305\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n14%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,421\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development (\u0093R&D\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nThe year-over-year growth in 2014 and 2013 R&D expense was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based\ncompensation costs and machinery and equipment to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are\ndirectly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\u0092s core business strategy. As such, the Company expects to make further investments in R&D to remain competitive. \n\n\n\n\nSelling, General and Administrative (\u0093SG&A\u0094) Expense \n\n\n\n\nThe growth in SG&A expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, including share-based\ncompensation costs; higher spending on marketing, advertising and professional services; and the Company\u0092s continued expansion of its Retail segment. The growth in SG&A during 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to the Company\u0092s\ncontinued expansion of its Retail segment and increased headcount and related expenses, partially offset by decreased spending on professional services. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nOther Income and Expense \n\n\n\n\nOther income and expense for 2014, 2013 and 2012 are as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2012\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,795\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,616\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a01,088\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInterest expense\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(384\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(136\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOther expense, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(431\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(324\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(566\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n980\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(15\n\n\n\n\n)%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n1,156\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n121\n\n\n\n\n%\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n522\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on\ndebt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income and expense during 2013 was\ndue primarily to higher interest and dividend income resulting from the Company\u0092s higher cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts, partially offset by interest expense on\ndebt issued in the third quarter of 2013 and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.11%, 1.03% and 1.03%\nduring 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals\nof existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation\nallowance. \n\n \n\nDuring the fiscal year ended September\u00a027, 2014, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u0093IRS\u0094) concluded its review of the\nyears 2004 through 2009. The IRS is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s\nexpectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n\n \n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No.\u00a02014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n(Topic 606) (\u0093ASU 2014-09\u0094), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are\ntransferred to customers.

To provide additional flexibility in managing liquidity, the\nCompany began accessing the commercial paper markets in the third quarter of 2014. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future dividends and the share repurchase program will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from\non-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. \n\n \n\nAs of September\u00a027, 2014 and September\u00a028, 2013, $137.1 billion and $111.3\nbillion, respectively, of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. \n\ndollar-denominated\n\n holdings. Amounts held by\nforeign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company\u0092s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits\nthe amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n\n\n\nDuring 2014, cash generated from operating activities of $59.7 billion was a result of $39.5 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of\n$13.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $22.6 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and\nmaturities, of $9.0 billion; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $9.6 billion; and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $37.5 billion during 2014 consisted\nprimarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $45.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1\u00a0billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and commercial paper of $12.0\nbillion and $6.3 billion, respectively. \n\n \n\nDuring 2013, cash generated from operating activities of $53.7 billion was a result of $37.0 billion of net\nincome, non-cash adjustments to net income of $10.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $6.5 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $33.8 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used for\npurchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $24.0 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $8.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $16.4 billion during 2013 consisted primarily of cash used\nto repurchase common stock of $22.9 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $10.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $16.9 billion. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nCapital Assets \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s capital expenditures were $11.0 billion during 2014, consisting of $491 million for retail store facilities and $10.5 billion for other\ncapital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment and other corporate facilities and infrastructure. The Company\u0092s actual cash payments for capital expenditures during 2014 were $9.6 billion. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company anticipates utilizing approximately $13.0 billion for capital expenditures during 2015, including approximately $600 million for retail store\nfacilities and approximately $12.4 billion for other capital expenditures, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, data centers and corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and\nenhancements. \n\n \n\nDuring 2015, the Company expects to open about 25 new retail stores, with approximately three-quarters located outside of the U.S.\nDuring 2015, the Company also expects to remodel approximately five of its existing stores. \n\n \n\nDebt \n\n\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u0093Commercial Paper\u0094) pursuant to a\ncommercial paper program. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of September\u00a027, 2014, the Company had $6.3 billion of\nCommercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally less than nine months. \n\n \n\nIn the third quarter of\n2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively\nthe \u0093Notes\u0094). The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate\npayments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into\nfloating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. \n\n\n\n\nCapital Return Program \n\n \n\nIn April 2014, the Company\u0092s Board\nof Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion of the Company\u0092s common stock, of which $67.9 billion had been utilized as of September\u00a027, 2014. The share repurchase program is expected to\nbe completed by the end of December 2015. The Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions,\nincluding under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe increase to the Company\u0092s share repurchase program authorization resulted in a total capital return\nprogram of over $130 billion. The Company expects to complete the capital return program by the end of December 2015 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of\nrestricted stock units. To assist in funding its capital return program, the Company expects to access the debt markets, both domestically and internationally. \n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents the Company\u0092s

\n\nOperating Leases \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. Leases for retail space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and\noften contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a027, 2014, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nPurchase Commitments \n\n\n\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and testing\nof finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products\nfrom a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders based on projected demand information. Where\nappropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. \n\n \n\nOther\nObligations \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s other obligations were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and\nmanufacturing process equipment and commitments related to advertising, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a027, 2014, the Company\nhad non-current deferred tax liabilities of $20.3 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a027, 2014, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4.0 billion and an additional $630 million for gross interest and penalties classified as\nnon-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above\ncontractual obligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnification \n\n \n\nThe Company\ngenerally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include\nindemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant\npayments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to\nindemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of\nSeptember\u00a027, 2014 or September\u00a028, 2013. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive\nofficers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such\nindividuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations and payments made under these agreements historically\nhave not been material. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n\n\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and\nthe Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements\nand accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u0094 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form\u00a010-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in\nthe preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the\nbasis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\n\n\n\nManagement believes the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of\nmarketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies\ncritical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior\nmanagement has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue\nfrom the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed\nor determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company\nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital\ncontent sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions:\n(i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware. \n\n\n\n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality, undelivered\nsoftware elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company\nuses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u0093TPE\u0094) and\n(iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u0092s best\nestimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\n \n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of\niOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features free of charge to customers. The Company also provides various non-software services to owners of qualifying\nversions of iOS devices and Mac. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue\nallocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are\nexpected to be provided for each of these devices, which ranges from two to four years. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves management\u0092s judgment and considers multiple\nfactors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u0092s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for software upgrades\nand non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights, the estimated or actual\ncosts incurred to provide non-software services and the estimated period software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions\ninvolving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The\nCompany\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost\nis recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u0092s historical\nexperience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to\nestimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of\ncustomers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n\n\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the\nCompany\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and\nlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would\nrequire the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;\nthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s\nassessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security. \n\n\n\n\nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing process\nequipment, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company\nrecords a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of\ninventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and\ninventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount\nby which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 40\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and\ncomponent obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory, inventory prepayments and/or manufacturing-related capital assets. These circumstances include future\ndemand or market conditions for the Company\u0092s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u0092s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets,\nor significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company\u0092s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u0092s manufacturing process equipment or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs\nwould adversely affect the Company\u0092s results of operations in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n \n\nThe Company records accruals for\nestimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and\nopen orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments that are outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s\nforecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products, if the Company\u0092s product development plans change, or if\nthere is an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u0092s products, then the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the\nperiod when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n \n\nWarranty Costs \n\n\n\n\nThe Company provides for the estimated cost of warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim\nrates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company re-evaluates these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded\nwarranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated\nwarranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s results of operations. \n\n \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n\n\n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. The provision for income taxes is computed\nusing the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for\noperating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or\nsettled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\nexamination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood\nof being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be\ngenerated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of\nthe net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities\ninvolves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material impact on\nthe Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 41\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies,\u0094 the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it\nis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies. However, the outcome of legal\nproceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\n\n \n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\n\n\nstand-alone\n\n basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management activities and the anticipatory\nnature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses\nrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nWhile the Company is exposed to interest\nrate fluctuations in many of the world\u0092s leading industrialized countries, the Company\u0092s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on\nthe Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u0092s debt. \n\n\n\n\nInvestments \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy\nare focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u0092s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in\nhighly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of\nprincipal loss. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company\nperformed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of\nSeptember\u00a027, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September\u00a028, 2013, a similar 100 basis\npoint increase in the yield curve would have resulted in a $2.7 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nDebt \n\n \n\nIn April\n2014, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to issue Commercial Paper pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\u00a027, 2014, the Company had $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with maturities generally less than\nnine months. \n\n \n\nIn the third quarters of 2014 and 2013, the Company issued $12.0 billion and $17.0 billion of long-term debt, respectively. The debt\nissuances included floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $29.0 billion (collectively the \u0093Notes\u0094). The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to\nmanage interest rate risk on the Notes. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. In the third quarter of 2014, the Company\nentered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted most of the fixed-rate notes into floating-rate notes, and in the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into interest rate swaps\nwith an aggregate notional amount of $3.0\u00a0billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes into fixed-rate notes. As of September\u00a027, 2014, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the\nCompany\u0092s debt to increase by $110 million on an annualized basis. \n\n \n\nFurther details regarding the Company\u0092s debt is provided in Part II,\nItem\u00a08 of this Form \n\n10-K\n\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, \u0093Debt.\u0094 \n\n \n\nForeign\nCurrency Risk \n\n \n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in\nparticular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive\npressures when there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and\noption contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign\nsubsidiaries. The Company\u0092s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons,\nincluding but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n \n\nTo provide a meaningful\nassessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given\nconfidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes\nnormal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum\none-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of September\u00a027, 2014 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $201 million as of September\u00a028, 2013. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the\nloss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future\ngains and losses associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a027, 2014 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting\nthe timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2014 Form 10-K | 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item\u00a01A.\n\n\nRisk Factors \n\n \n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These\nrisk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item\u00a07, \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\nof Operations\u0094 and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u0093Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u0094 of this Form 10-K. \n\n\n\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown,\nincluding but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u0092s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial\ncondition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u0092s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price. \n\n\n\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, past financial\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\n\n\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional\neconomic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or\nasset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u0092s expectations\nas a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or\nregional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer\nspending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u0092s products and services. \n\n \n\nIn the\nevent of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the\ncredit\u00a0markets, low liquidity and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u0092s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of\noutsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases\nof the Company\u0092s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Company\u0092s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations\ndepending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; changes in interest rates;\u00a0increases or\ndecreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual\namounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u0092s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\n\n\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u0092s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the\nCompany may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services compete in highly competitive global\nmarkets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance\ncharacteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it\ndesigns and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. The Company\ncurrently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u0092s competitors seek to compete primarily through\naggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u0092s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with\nattractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u0092s intellectual property, the Company\u0092s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system\nand also markets related third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established\nhardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and\nattempt to imitate the Company\u0092s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with\nbusiness models that include content provided to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate ways to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company\u0092s competitors have greater experience, product breadth\nand distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a\nloss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u0092s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u0092s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using OS X, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been\ncontracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product\nlines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors selling Windows-based personal computers\nhave aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the\nCompany\u0092s existing products. The Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages. \n\n\n\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\n\n\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\n\n\n \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new\nproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product\nintroductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u0092s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the\navailability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to\nmeet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and\ntransitions. \n\n \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of\nwhom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized\nbusinesses through its online and retail stores. \n\n \n\nCarriers providing cellular network service for iPhone typically subsidize users\u0092 purchases of\nthe device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u0092s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nMany resellers have narrow operating margins and have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic\nconditions. Some resellers have perceived the expansion of the Company\u0092s direct sales as conflicting with their business interests as distributors and resellers of the Company\u0092s products. Such a perception could discourage resellers from\ninvesting resources in the distribution and sale of the Company\u0092s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of those products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including\nstaffing selected resellers\u0092 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The\nfinancial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u0092s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u0092s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering\nand marketing of the Company\u0092s products. \n\n \n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase\ncommitment cancellation risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed\nanticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities\nand inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which\nthe carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be\ngiven that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry\npractice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component\nprepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u0092s markets are volatile,\ncompetitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\n\n\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities. \n\n\n\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many\ncomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components,\nthere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the\nsupplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u0092s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u0092s suppliers, described\nin \u0093\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u0094\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u0092s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks\nof supply shortages and price increases. \n\n \n\nThe Company and other participants in the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal\ncomputers also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common to the rest of these industries. The Company\u0092s new\nproducts often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u0092 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased.\nContinued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet\nthe Company\u0092s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by\noutsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\n \n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u0092s manufacturing is performed in\nwhole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u0092s\ndirect control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u0092s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect\nor warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on\noutsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u0092s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u0092s cost or supply of components\nor finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system\nfailures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. \n\n \n\nThe Company has\ninvested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the\nsupply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of\nthese assets could be negatively impacted. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time\nthat can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation. \n\n \n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and\nsoftware products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u0093bugs\u0094 that can unexpectedly interfere with the\nsoftware\u0092s intended operation. The Company\u0092s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be\nno assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company\u0092s reputation.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms\nor at all. \n\n \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content. This includes the right to sell currently\navailable music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at\nall. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their\ncontent in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u0092s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable\nprices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material\nadverse impact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to\nprovide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such\nsolutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of\ncontent and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u0092s content providers. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s future performance depends in part on support from \n\nthird-party\n\n software developers. \n\n \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware\nproducts depend in part on the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and\nservices for the Company\u0092s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u0092s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u0092s products. \n\n\n\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of \n\nthird-party\n\n software applications and\nservices depends in part on the developers\u0092 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company\u0092s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based\non factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u0092s minority\nshare of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac\u0092s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u0092s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to\ndeveloping and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\n \n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and\ndevelopment of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose\nnot to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u0092s Mac products, the availability and development of these\napplications also depend on developers\u0092 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company\u0092s iOS devices rather than its competitors\u0092 platforms, such as Android. If\ndevelopers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u0092s iOS devices may suffer. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable\nterms or at all. \n\n \n\nMany of the Company\u0092s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third\nparties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all.\nFailure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the\nCompany\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings,\nsuch as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that\nhave not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future. \n\n \n\nFor\nexample, technology companies, including many of the Company\u0092s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies\nseek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As the Company has grown, the intellectual property rights claims against it have increased and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company\u0092s cellular enabled products\ncompete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the number of patent claims against the Company has significantly increased.\u00a0The Company is vigorously defending\ninfringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial\ndamages. \n\n \n\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or\nactual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products. \n\n\n\n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses\ncan be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u0092s operating expenses. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the\nCompany\u0092s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation. \n\n\n\n\nIn management\u0092s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess\nof a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. \n\n\n\n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a\nreporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant\ncompensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u0092s costs and individually or in\nthe aggregate adversely affect the Company\u0092s business. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and\ninternational operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u0092s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate,\nbilling, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls\nand cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety. \n\n \n\nBy way of example, laws and\nregulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture,\ndistribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u0092s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u0092s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization\nbodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment\ndates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\n \n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous\nand expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in\ntheir interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u0092s products and services less attractive to the Company\u0092s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change\nor limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u0092s employees, contractors, or agents will not\nviolate such laws and regulations or the Company\u0092s policies and procedures. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to the risks of\ninternational operations. \n\n \n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance\nwith applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws\nand anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u0092s employees,\ncontractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u0092s brand, international growth efforts and business. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and\nlabor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be\nmaterially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international\nmarkets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial\ninvestment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s retail stores have required\nsubstantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to\nserve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the\nCompany\u0092s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u0092s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease\ntermination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. \n\n \n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which\nare beyond the Company\u0092s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u0092s\ninability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\u0092s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs\nassociated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\u0092s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\n\n\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u0092s ongoing business and present risks not originally\ncontemplated. \n\n \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u0092s due\ndiligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business and reputation may be\nimpacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions. \n\n \n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system\nfailures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.\nSystem redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u0092s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the Company\u0092s online\nstores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online\nservices, transactions processing and financial reporting. \n\n \n\nThere may be breaches of the Company\u0092s information technology systems\nthat materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information\n(\u0093PII\u0094). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect\nmany companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication\ntechnologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty\npassword management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the\nCompany\u0092s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of\ncustomer orders. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 14\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures\nto protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage\nbusiness partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u0092s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII,\nthe Company\u0092s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\u0092s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Company maintains\ninsurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types\nof claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business is subject to a variety of U.S.\nand international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and\ninternational laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and\namong the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue\nto develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices.\nNoncompliance could result in penalties or significant legal liability. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s privacy policy, which includes related practices\nconcerning the use and disclosure of data, is posted on its website. Any failure by the Company, its suppliers or other parties with whom the Company does business to comply with its posted privacy policy or with other federal, state or\ninternational privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and\nobligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer\ninformation is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. \n\n\n\n\nMuch of the Company\u0092s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer,\nexecutive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u0092s key personnel are\nlocated. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and\nother business interruptions. \n\n \n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused\nand could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners.\nThe Company\u0092s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile\nacts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u0092s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers,\nincluding channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u0092s supply chain. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected\nby more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the\nCompany\u0092s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u0092s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component\nsuppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant\nexpenditures in order to resume operations. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\u0092s software, accessories, and service and support\ncontracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u0092s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u0092s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and\nconfiguration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u0092s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u0092s gross\nmargin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition,\nor the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. \n\n \n\nThe Company has typically\nexperienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the\nCompany generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as\nlower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u0092s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u0092s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price is subject to volatility. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the\nCompany, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u0092 operating performance. Price\nvolatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u0092s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth\nand profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are\nsubject to declaration by the Company\u0092s Board of Directors, and the Company\u0092s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth,\nprofitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local\ncurrencies. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales\nand operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise\ninternational pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u0092s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u0092s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u0092s strengthening, or at all, which\nwould adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u0092s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u0092s\nforeign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies\nmay also increase the Company\u0092s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nuses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the\nadverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\n \n\nThe Company\nis exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio. \n\n \n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the\nCompany has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company\u0092s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or\nother factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also\nsells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u0092s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing\narrangements or credit insurance. The Company\u0092s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured\nvendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a026, 2015, a significant portion of the Company\u0092s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade\nreceivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor\nnon-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities. \n\n \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number\nof the Company\u0092s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u0092s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of\nearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. For example, in June 2014, the European\nCommission opened a formal investigation of Ireland to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities with regard to the corporate income tax to be paid by two of the Company\u0092s Irish subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.\nIf the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, it could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid, and such amount could be material. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and\ngovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If\nthe Company\u0092s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u0092s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u0092s financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\n\n \n\nFiscal 2015 Highlights \n\n \n\nNet sales rose 28% or $50.9\nbillion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a 52% year-over-year increase in iPhone\n\n\u00ae\n\n net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Company\u0092s reportable\noperating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Services and Other Products. Apple Watch\n\n\u00ae\n\n,\nwhich launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies\nrelative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad\n\n\u00ae\n\n net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company\u0092s reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China\nwhere year-over-year net sales increased 84%. \n\n \n\nIn April 2015, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising\nthe expected total size of the program to $200 billion through March 2017. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in May 2015. During 2015, the\nCompany spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $14.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated,\n\n\n\u0080\n\n4.8 billion of euro-denominated, SFr1.3 billion of Swiss franc-denominated, \u00a31.3 billion of British pound-denominated, A$2.3 billion of Australian dollar-denominated and \u00a5250.0 billion\nof Japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015. \n\n \n\nFiscal 2014 Highlights \n\n\n\n\nNet sales rose 7% or $11.9 billion during 2014 compared to 2013. This was driven by increases in net sales of iPhone, Mac and Services. Net sales and unit\nsales increased for iPhone primarily due to the successful introduction of iPhone 5s and 5c in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and expanded distribution.\nMac net sales and unit sales increased primarily due to strong demand for MacBook Air\n\n\u00ae\n\n and MacBook Pro\n\n\u00ae\n\n which were updated in 2014 with\nfaster processors and offered at lower prices. Net sales of Services grew primarily due to increased revenue from sales through the App Store\n\n\u00ae\n\n, AppleCare\n\n\u00ae\n\n and licensing. Growth in these areas was partially offset by the year-over-year decline in net sales for iPad due to lower unit sales in many markets, and a decline in net sales of Other\nProducts. All of the Company\u0092s operating segments other than the Rest of Asia Pacific segment experienced increased net sales in 2014, with growth being strongest in the Greater China and Japan operating segments. \n\n\n\n\nDuring 2014, the Company completed various business acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription streaming\nmusic service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes Beats\n\n\u00ae\n\n headphones, speakers and audio software. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn April 2014, the Company increased its share repurchase authorization to $90 billion and the quarterly\ndividend was raised to $0.47 per common share, resulting in an overall increase in its capital return program from $100 billion to over $130 billion. During 2014, the Company utilized $45 billion to repurchase its common stock and paid dividends and\ndividend equivalents of $11.1 billion. The Company also issued $12.0 billion of long-term debt during 2014, with varying maturities through 2044, and launched a commercial paper program, with $6.3 billion outstanding as of September\u00a027, 2014.\n\n\n \n\nSales Data \n\n \n\nThe following table shows net sales by\noperating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions

Overall average selling prices (\u0093ASPs\u0094) for iPhone increased by 11% during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by the effect of\nweakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. \n\n \n\nThe year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2014 resulted\nprimarily from the successful introduction of new iPhones in the latter half of calendar year 2013, the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus beginning in September 2014, and expanded distribution. iPhone unit sales grew in all of the\nCompany\u0092s operating segments, while iPhone net sales grew in all segments except Rest of Asia Pacific. Overall ASPs for iPhone were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013, with growth in ASPs in the Americas segment being offset by a decline\nin ASPs in the Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments. \n\n \n\niPad \n\n\n\n\nThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n23,227\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(23)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n30,283\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(5)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n31,980\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n17%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnit sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a054,856\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(19)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a067,977\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n(4)%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a071,033\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales\nis due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company\u0092s other products. iPad ASPs declined by 5% during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the effect of weakness in most foreign\ncurrencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads. \n\n \n\nNet sales and unit sales for iPad declined in 2014 compared to\n2013. iPad net sales and unit sales grew in the Greater China and Japan segments but this growth was more than offset by a decline in all other segments. Overall iPad ASPs were relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013 with a shift in mix to\nhigher-priced iPads being offset by the October 2013 price reduction of iPad mini\u0099. ASPs increased in the Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific segments but were slightly down in other segments. \n\n\n\n\nMac \n\n \n\nThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales\ninformation for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions and units in thousands): \n\n \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNet sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n25,471\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n24,079\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n12%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n21,483\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n13%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nUnit sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n20,587\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18,906\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n16,341\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe year-over-year growth in Mac net sales and unit sales during 2015 was driven by strong demand for Mac portables.

The foregoing statement regarding the Company\u0092s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of 2016 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The\nCompany\u0092s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 and those described in this paragraph. In\ngeneral, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product\ntransitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u0092s sales mix towards\nproducts with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u0092s\nability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u0092s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross\nmargins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\n \n\nOperating Expenses \n\n\n\n\nOperating expenses for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nChange\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and development\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n8,067\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n34%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n6,041\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n35%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n4,475\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n3%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n14,329\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n19%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n11,993\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n11%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n10,830\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n7%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n6%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n22,396\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n24%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n18,034\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n18%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n15,305\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n10%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n9%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nResearch and Development \n\n \n\nThe\nyear-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2015 and 2014 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including share-based compensation costs, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities.

The decrease in other income and expense during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and higher\nexpenses associated with foreign exchange rate movements, partially offset by lower premium expenses on foreign exchange contracts and higher interest income. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities was 1.49%, 1.11% and 1.03% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. \n\n \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\n\n\n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n19,121\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,973\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n13,118\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nEffective tax rate\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n26.4%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n26.1%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n26.2%\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s effective tax rates for 2015, 2014 and 2013 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%\ndue primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside\nthe U.S. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes.

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of\nexisting taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation\nallowance. \n\n \n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the years 2010 through 2012, and all years prior to 2010 are closed. In\naddition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing\nauthorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u0092s\ntax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u0092s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. \n\n\n\n\nOn June\u00a011, 2014, the European Commission issued an opening decision initiating a formal investigation against Ireland for alleged state aid to the\nCompany. The opening decision concerns the allocation of profits for taxation purposes of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company. The Company believes the European Commission\u0092s assertions are without merit. If the European\nCommission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could require Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be material, as of\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 29\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\n\n\n\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u0093FASB\u0094) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u0093ASU\u0094) No.\u00a02014-09, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u0093ASU 2014-09\u0094), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to\nbe entitled when products are transferred to customers. \n\n \n\nThe original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company to adopt\nbeginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.\u00a02015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) \u0096 Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year and\npermits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its first quarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period\npresented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its consolidated financial\nstatements. \n\n \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\n \n\nThe following\ntable presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended September\u00a026, 2015, September\u00a027, 2014 and September\u00a028, 2013 (in millions): \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2014\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2013\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0205,666\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0155,239\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0146,761\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n22,471\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n20,624\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n16,597\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCommercial paper\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n8,499\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n6,308\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nTotal term debt\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n55,963\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n28,987\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n16,960\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking capital\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n8,768\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n5,083\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n29,628\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash generated by operating activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n81,266\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n59,713\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n53,666\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash used in investing activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(56,274\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(22,579\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(33,774\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nCash used in financing activities\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(17,716\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(37,549\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n$\n\n\n\n\n(16,379\n\n\n\n\n)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to\nsatisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. The Company currently anticipates the cash used for future\ndividends, the share repurchase program and debt repayments will come from its current domestic cash, cash generated from on-going U.S. operating activities and from borrowings. \n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2015 and September\u00a027, 2014, the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign\nsubsidiaries were $186.9 billion and $137.1 billion, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. \n\ndollar-denominated\n\n holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income\ntaxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company\u0092s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The\npolicy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. \n\n \n\nDuring 2015,\ncash generated from operating activities of $81.3 billion was a result of $53.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.2 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $11.7 billion. Cash\nused in investing activities of $56.3 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $44.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $11.2 billion.\nCash used in financing activities of $17.7 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $35.3 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds\nfrom the issuance of term debt of $27.1 billion. \n\n \n\nDuring 2014, cash generated from operating activities of $59.7 billion was a result of $39.5\nbillion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $13.2 billion and an increase in net change in operating assets and liabilities of $7.0 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $22.6 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash\nused for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $9.0 billion; cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $9.6 billion; and cash paid for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion. Cash used\nin financing activities of $37.5 billion during 2014 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $45.0 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the\nissuance of term debt and commercial paper of $12.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nCapital Assets \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s capital expenditures were $11.2 billion during 2015.

The Company expects to execute\nthe capital return program by the end of March 2017 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units. To assist in funding its capital return\nprogram, the Company expects to continue to access the debt markets, both domestically and internationally. As of September\u00a026, 2015, $104 billion of the share repurchase program has been utilized. The Company\u0092s share repurchase program\ndoes not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares.

\n\nOperating Leases \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s major facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a026, 2015, the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail space are for terms\nranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of September\u00a026, 2015, the Company\u0092s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $6.3\nbillion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail space. \n\n \n\nPurchase Commitments \n\n\n\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u0092s products and to perform final assembly and testing\nof finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products\nfrom a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Where\nappropriate,\u00a0the\u00a0purchases are applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. As of September\u00a026, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party\nmanufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of $29.5 billion. \n\n \n\nOther Obligations \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s other off-balance sheet obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and\nmanufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments, advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations. \n\n\n\n\nThe Company\u0092s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax\nbenefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of September\u00a026, 2015, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $24.1 billion. Additionally, as of September\u00a026, 2015, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits\nof $6.9 billion and an additional $1.3 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in\nconnection with these tax liabilities; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table. \n\n \n\nIndemnification \n\n\n\n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes\nthird-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the\nCompany or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application\nsoftware for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of September\u00a026, 2015 or September\u00a027, 2014. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 32\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2015, the Company introduced the iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who\npurchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U.S. physical retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone,\nprovided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the\nCompany satisfies the customer\u0092s outstanding balance due to the third-party lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such\nright with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue. \n\n \n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its\ndirectors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance\nexpenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of\nprior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations. \n\n\n\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\n \n\nThe preparation of\nfinancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093GAAP\u0094) and the Company\u0092s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the\nCompany\u0092s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u0093Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u0094 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates, and such differences may be material. \n\n \n\nManagement believes the Company\u0092s critical accounting policies and estimates are those\nrelated to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation and valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and\nother contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about\ninherently uncertain matters. The Company\u0092s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u0092s Board of Directors. \n\n\n\n\nRevenue Recognition \n\n \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue\nfrom the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed\nor determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u0092s product sales, these criteria\nare met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company\nretains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u0092s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price\nis fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the\nfunctionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting\nguidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\n\n\n \n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u0092s functionality,\nundelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u0092s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances,\nthe Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u0093VSOE\u0094), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price\n(\u0093TPE\u0094) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u0093ESP\u0094). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the\nCompany\u0092s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 33\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it\nmay from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\u0092s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the\nnon-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u0092s ESPs is deferred and\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided. \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s process for determining ESPs involves management\u0092s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and\ncircumstances change, the Company\u0092s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the\nunspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected\nto be provided. \n\n \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive\nprograms. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition\nhave been met. The Company\u0092s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u0092s other customer incentive programs,\nthe estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the\nCompany\u0092s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive\nprograms require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u0092s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a\ngreater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s operating results. \n\n\n\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities \n\n \n\nThe\nCompany\u0092s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the\nCompany\u0092s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u0092s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and\nlosses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u0092s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would\nrequire the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost;\nthe financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u0092s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u0092s\nassessment on whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s operating\nresults. \n\n \n\nInventory Valuation and Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimated Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees \n\n\n\n\nThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including\ncapital assets held at its suppliers\u0092 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down\nfor inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers\nmultiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for\nimpairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value\nof such an asset exceeds its fair value. \n\n \n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and\ncomponent obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or manufacturing-related assets. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the\nCompany\u0092s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u0092s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the\nfinancial condition of one or more of the Company\u0092s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u0092s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company\u0092s\nfinancial condition and operating results in the period when the write-downs were recorded. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 34\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nThe Company accrues for estimated cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or\nare expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Where appropriate, the purchases\nare applied to\u00a0inventory component prepayments\u00a0that are\u00a0outstanding with the\u00a0respective supplier. Purchase commitments typically cover the Company\u0092s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150\ndays. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u0092s products, a change in the Company\u0092s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the\nCompany\u0092s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded. \n\n\n\n\nWarranty Costs \n\n \n\nThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of\nwarranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u0092s typical\nexperience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities or the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product\nfailure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nIncome Taxes \n\n \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the\nanticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences\nof temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that\napply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than\nnot to be realized. \n\n \n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will\nbe sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than\n50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. \n\n \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income\nthat may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all\nor part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax\nliabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u0092s expectations could have a material\nimpact on the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u0093Legal Proceedings\u0094 and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u0093Commitments and Contingencies,\u0094 the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it\nis probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management,\nthere was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal\nproceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u0092s expectations, the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "item7a": ">Item\u00a07A.\n\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \n\n \n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\n\n \n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a\n\n\nstand-alone\n\n basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u0092s risk management activities and the anticipatory\nnature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses\nrelated to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u0092s financial condition and operating results. \n\n\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s exposure to changes in\ninterest rates relates primarily to the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u0092s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in\nU.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u0092s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid\non the Company\u0092s debt. \n\n \n\nThe Company\u0092s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the\nCompany\u0092s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its\ninvestment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a\nmeaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment\nportfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a026, 2015 and September\u00a027, 2014, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would\nresult in a $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity. \n\n\n\n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2015 and September\u00a027, 2014, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an\naggregate carrying amount of $56.0 billion and $29.0 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the\nCompany to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related\nhedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u0092s debt as of September\u00a026, 2015 and September\u00a027, 2014 to increase by $200 million and $110 million on an annualized\nbasis, respectively. \n\n \n\nFurther details regarding the Company\u0092s debt is provided in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form \n\n10-K\n\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, \u0093Debt.\u0094 \n\n \n\nForeign Currency Risk \n\n\n\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u0092s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures\nwhen there have been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. \n\n \n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option\ncontracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company\u0092s\npractice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to\naccounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 36\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the\nCompany\u0092s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u0093VAR\u0094) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a\nMonte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u0092s foreign currency derivative\npositions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and\nassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of September\u00a026, 2015\ncompared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $240 million as of September\u00a027, 2014. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by\nincreases in the fair value of the underlying exposures. \n\n \n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u0092s investment portfolio and\nderivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a026, 2015 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency\nexchanges rates and the Company\u0092s actual exposures and positions. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n \n\nApple Inc. | 2015 Form 10-K | 37\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item\u00a07, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. \n\nIn the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u2019s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u2019s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; changes in interest rates;\u00a0increases or decreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u2019s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers. \n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company's\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n8\n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant price competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u2019s existing products. The Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its online and retail stores. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers. \n\nMany resellers have been adversely affected in the past by weak economic conditions. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n9\n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts and open orders, in each case based on projected demand. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u201d\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases. \n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.  \n\nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n10\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u201cbugs\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. The Company\u2019s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns, or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make available third-party digital content, or to make available such content on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third\u2011party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products. \n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third\u2011party software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company\u2019s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u2019s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac\u2019s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. \n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, which are distributed through a single distribution channel, the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u2019s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u2019 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company\u2019s iOS devices rather than its competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s iOS devices may suffer. \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n11\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. \n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business, and additional claims may arise in the future.\n\nFor example, technology companies, including many of the Company\u2019s competitors, frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. The intellectual property rights claims against the Company have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company's cellular enabled products compete with products from mobile communication and media device companies that hold significant patent portfolios, and the Company has faced a significant number of patent claims against it. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or\u00a0other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, regardless of whether it can develop non-infringing technology, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party, or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain products.  \n\nIn certain cases, the Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation.\n\nIn management\u2019s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. \n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results. \n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.\n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u2019s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u2019s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.\u00a0 \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n12\n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to the Company\u2019s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. \n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to the risks of international operations.\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s brand, international growth efforts and business.\n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs. \n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u2019s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\u2019s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\u2019s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u2019s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. \n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could, among other things, prevent access to the Company\u2019s online stores and services, preclude retail store transactions, compromise Company or customer data, and result in delayed or cancelled orders. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and shipping of products, delivery of online services, transactions processing and financial reporting.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n13\n\nThere may be breaches of the Company\u2019s information technology systems that materially damage business partner and customer relationships, curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services, or subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store customer, employee and business partner personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). This may include, among other information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. Although malicious attacks to gain access to PII affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the amount of PII it manages.  \n\nThe Company requires user names and passwords in order to access its information technology systems. The Company also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Company data or accounts. As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which may result in the delay or loss of customer orders. \n\nThe Company devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. To the extent the Company was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could materially damage business partner and customer relationships, and curtail or otherwise adversely impact access to online stores and services. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Company\u2019s systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Company\u2019s reputation and brand could be materially damaged, use of the Company\u2019s products and services could decrease, and the Company could be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber risk.\n\nThe Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for associated expenses and penalties. In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. Penalties could include ongoing audit requirements or significant legal liability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n14\n\nThe Company\u2019s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions.\n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u2019s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply chain. While the Company's suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company's business and harm to the Company's reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u2019s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\u2019s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u2019s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u2019s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u2019s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing. \n\nThe Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n15\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u2019s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may also increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in a significant realized loss.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n16",

The Company\u2019s products and services include iPhone\n\n\u00ae\n\n, iPad\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Mac\n\n\u00ae\n\n, iPod\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Apple Watch\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Apple TV\n\n\u00ae\n\n, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS\u2122, watchOS\n\n\u00ae\n\n and tvOS\u2122 operating systems, iCloud\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Apple Pay\n\n\u00ae\n\n and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store\n\n\u00ae\n\n, App Store\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store\u2122 and Apple Music\n\n\u00ae\n\n (collectively \u201cInternet Services\u201d). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\nFiscal 2016 Highlights\n\nNet sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iPhone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in Services. In April 2016, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $200 billion to $250 billion through March 2018. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $140 billion to $175 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.52 to $0.57 per share beginning in May 2016. During 2016, the Company spent $29.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $23.9 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated term debt and A$1.4 billion of Australian dollar-denominated term debt during 2016.\n\nFiscal 2015 Highlights\n\nNet sales rose 28% or $50.9 billion during 2015 compared to 2014, driven by a year-over-year increase in iPhone net sales. iPhone net sales and unit sales in 2015 increased in all of the Company\u2019s reportable operating segments. The Company also experienced year-over-year net sales increases in Mac, Services and Other Products. Apple Watch, which launched during the third quarter of 2015, accounted for more than 100% of the year-over-year growth in net sales of Other Products. Net sales growth during 2015 was partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower iPad net sales. Total net sales increased in each of the Company\u2019s reportable operating segments, with particularly strong growth in Greater China where year-over-year net sales increased 84%.\n\nIn April 2015, the Company announced a significant increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program to $200 billion through March 2017. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion and raising its quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share beginning in May 2015. During 2015, the Company spent $36.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion. Additionally, the Company issued $14.5 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated, \u20ac4.8 billion of euro-denominated, SFr1.3 billion of Swiss franc-denominated, \u00a31.3 billion of British pound-denominated, A$2.3 billion of Australian dollar-denominated and \u00a5250.0 billion of Japanese yen-denominated term debt during 2015.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n22\n\nSales Data\n\nThe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nNet Sales by Operating Segment:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAmericas\n\n$\n\n86,613\n\n\u00a0\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n93,864\n\n\u00a0\n\n17\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n80,095\n\nEurope\n\n49,952\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n50,337\n\n\u00a0\n\n14\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n44,285\n\nGreater China\n\n48,492\n\n\u00a0\n\n(17\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n58,715\n\n\u00a0\n\n84\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n31,853\n\nJapan\n\n16,928\n\n\u00a0\n\n8\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n15,706\n\n\u00a0\n\n3\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n15,314\n\nRest of Asia Pacific\n\n13,654\n\n\u00a0\n\n(10\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n15,093\n\n\u00a0\n\n34\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n11,248\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n215,639\n\n\u00a0\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n233,715\n\n\u00a0\n\n28\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n182,795\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nNet Sales by Product:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\niPhone \n\n(1)\n\n$\n\n136,700\n\n\u00a0\n\n(12\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n155,041\n\n\u00a0\n\n52\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n101,991\n\niPad\n\n\u00a0(1)\n\n20,628\n\n\u00a0\n\n(11\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n23,227\n\n\u00a0\n\n(23\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n30,283\n\nMac \n\n(1)\n\n22,831\n\n\u00a0\n\n(10\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n25,471\n\n\u00a0\n\n6\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n24,079\n\nServices \n\n(2)\n\n24,348\n\n\u00a0\n\n22\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n19,909\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n18,063\n\nOther Products \n\n(1)(3)\n\n11,132\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n10,067\n\n\u00a0\n\n20\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n8,379\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n215,639\n\n\u00a0\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n233,715\n\n\u00a0\n\n28\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n182,795\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUnit Sales by Product:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\niPhone\n\n211,884\n\n\u00a0\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n231,218\n\n\u00a0\n\n37\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n169,219\n\niPad\n\n45,590\n\n\u00a0\n\n(17\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n54,856\n\n\u00a0\n\n(19\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n67,977\n\nMac\n\n18,484\n\n\u00a0\n\n(10\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n20,587\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n18,906\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1)\n\nIncludes deferrals and amortization of related software upgrade rights and non-software services.\n\n(2)\n\nIncludes revenue from Internet Services, AppleCare\n\n\u00ae\n\n, Apple Pay, licensing and other services.\n\n(3)\n\nIncludes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats\n\n\u00ae\n\n products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n23\n\nProduct Performance\n\niPhone\n\nThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nNet sales\n\n$\n\n136,700\n\n\u00a0\n\n(12\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n155,041\n\n\u00a0\n\n52\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n101,991\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n63\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n66\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n56\n\n%\n\nUnit sales\n\n211,884\n\n\u00a0\n\n(8\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n231,218\n\n\u00a0\n\n37\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n169,219\n\niPhone net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015. The Company believes the sales decline is due primarily to a lower rate of iPhone upgrades during 2016 compared to 2015 and challenging macroeconomic conditions in a number of major markets in 2016. Average selling prices (\u201cASPs\u201d) for iPhone were lower year-over-year during 2016 due primarily to a different mix of iPhones, including the iPhone SE introduced in 2016, and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe year-over-year growth in iPhone net sales and unit sales during 2015 primarily resulted from strong demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus during 2015. Overall ASPs for iPhone increased during 2015 compared to 2014, due primarily to the introduction of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in September 2014, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\niPad\n\nThe following table presents iPad net sales and unit sales information for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nNet sales\n\n$\n\n20,628\n\n\u00a0\n\n(11\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n23,227\n\n\u00a0\n\n(23\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n30,283\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n10\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n17\n\n%\n\nUnit sales\n\n45,590\n\n\u00a0\n\n(17\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n54,856\n\n\u00a0\n\n(19\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n67,977\n\niPad net sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower unit sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by higher ASPs due to a shift in mix to higher-priced iPads. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company's other products.\n\nNet sales and unit sales for iPad declined during 2015 compared to 2014. The Company believes the decline in iPad sales is due in part to a longer repurchase cycle for iPads and some level of cannibalization from the Company's other products. iPad ASPs declined during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily as a result of the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and a shift in mix to lower-priced iPads. \n\nMac\n\nThe following table presents Mac net sales and unit sales information for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nNet sales\n\n$\n\n22,831\n\n\u00a0\n\n(10\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n25,471\n\n\u00a0\n\n6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n24,079\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n13\n\n%\n\nUnit sales\n\n18,484\n\n\u00a0\n\n(10\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n20,587\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n18,906\n\nMac net sales and unit sales decreased during 2016 compared to 2015.

Mac ASPs declined during 2015 compared to 2014 largely due to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n24\n\nServices\n\nThe following table presents net sales information of Services for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nNet sales\n\n$\n\n24,348\n\n\u00a0\n\n22\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n19,909\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n18,063\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\nThe year-over-year increase in net sales of Services in 2016 was due primarily to growth from the App Store, licensing and AppleCare sales, partially offset by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The Company\u2019s reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable operating segments. Although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

to 2015 due primarily to the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, unfavorable leverage on fixed costs from lower net sales, partially offset by a favorable shift in mix to Services.\n\nThe year-over-year increase in the gross margin percentage in 2015 was driven primarily by a favorable shift in mix to products with higher margins and, to a lesser extent, by improved leverage on fixed costs from higher net sales. These positive factors were partially offset primarily by higher product cost structures and, to a lesser extent, by the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n26\n\nThe Company anticipates gross margin during the first quarter of \n\n2017\n\n to be between 38% and 38.5%. The foregoing statement regarding the Company\u2019s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of \n\n2017\n\n is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u2019s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n are as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nResearch and development\n\n$\n\n10,045\n\n\u00a0\n\n25\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,067\n\n\u00a0\n\n34\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n6,041\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n3\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n3\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n$\n\n14,194\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n14,329\n\n\u00a0\n\n19\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n11,993\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n7\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n7\n\n%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n24,239\n\n\u00a0\n\n8\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n22,396\n\n\u00a0\n\n24\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n18,034\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2016 and 2015 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nThe decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount and related expenses. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 was primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses, and higher spending on marketing and advertising.\n\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\n\nOther income/(expense), net for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n are as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n$\n\n3,999\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n2,921\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,795\n\nInterest expense\n\n(1,456\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(733\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(384\n\n)\n\nOther expense, net\n\n(1,195\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(903\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(431\n\n)\n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n$\n\n1,348\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,285\n\n\u00a0\n\n31\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n980\n\nThe year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 and 2015 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and higher expenses associated with foreign exchange activity. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.73%, 1.49% and 1.11% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n27\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n are as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n15,685\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n19,121\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n13,973\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n25.6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n26.4\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n26.1\n\n%\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rates for \n\n2016\n\n, \n\n2015\n\n and \n\n2014\n\n differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits. The higher effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due primarily to higher foreign taxes. \n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $4.1 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reached a partial settlement with the IRS on its examination of the years 2010 through 2012. In connection with this settlement, the Company recognized a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2016 that was not significant to its consolidated financial statements. All years prior to 2013 are closed, except for the years 2010 through 2012 relating to R&D tax credits. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \"State Aid Decision\"). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through September 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of the beginning of 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and intends to appeal to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also announced its intention to appeal the State Aid Decision. While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to \u20ac13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due would be creditable against U.S. taxes. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other than Inventory (\"ASU 2016-16\"), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs.

ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\n \n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments \u2013 Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019. The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments.

The Company does not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. \n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n \n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019, and early adoption is permitted.\u00a0\n\nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No.\u00a02016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d); and ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the \u201cnew revenue standards\u201d).\u00a0\n\nThe new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company currently expects to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2018 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The Company does not expect adoption of the new revenue standards to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a027, 2014\n\n (in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\n\u00a0\n\n2014\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n$\n\n237,585\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n205,666\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n155,239\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n27,010\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n22,471\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n20,624\n\nCommercial paper\n\n$\n\n8,105\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,499\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n6,308\n\nTotal term debt\n\n$\n\n78,927\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n55,829\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n28,987\n\nWorking capital\n\n$\n\n27,863\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,768\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n5,083\n\nCash generated by operating activities\n\n$\n\n65,824\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n81,266\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n59,713\n\nCash used in investing activities\n\n$\n\n(45,977\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(56,274\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(22,579\n\n)\n\nCash used in financing activities\n\n$\n\n(20,483\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(17,716\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(37,549\n\n)\n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. In connection with the State Aid Decision, the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to \u20ac13 billion, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, pending conclusion of all appeals. \n\nThe Company\u2019s marketable securities investment portfolio is invested primarily in highly-rated securities and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss.\n\nDuring 2016, cash generated from operating activities of $65.8 billion was a result of $45.7 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $19.7 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $484 million. Cash used in investing activities of $46.0 billion during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $30.6 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $12.7 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $20.5 billion during 2016 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $29.7 billion, cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $12.2 billion and cash used to repay term debt of $2.5 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $25.0 billion.\n\nDuring 2015, cash generated from operating activities of $81.3 billion was a result of $53.4 billion of net income, non-cash adjustments to net income of $16.2 billion and an increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities of $11.6 billion. Cash used in investing activities of $56.3 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used for purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, of $44.4 billion and cash used to acquire property, plant and equipment of $11.2 billion. Cash used in financing activities of $17.7 billion during 2015 consisted primarily of cash used to repurchase common stock of $35.3 billion and cash used to pay dividends and dividend equivalents of $11.6 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of term debt of $27.1 billion.\n\n\u00a0\n\nCapital Assets\n\nThe Company\u2019s capital expenditures were $12.8 billion during \n\n2016\n\n. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $16.0 billion for capital expenditures during \n\n2017\n\n, which includes product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; data centers; corporate facilities and infrastructure, including information systems hardware, software and enhancements; and retail store facilities.\n\nDebt\n\nThe Company issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. The Company uses the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had $8.1 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.45% and maturities generally less than nine months.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company has outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $78.4 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d). During 2016, the Company repaid $2.5 billion of its Notes upon maturity. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on the Notes. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into currency swaps to manage foreign currency risk on the Notes.

Additionally in April 2016, the Company announced that the Board of Directors raised the rate of the Company's quarterly cash dividend by 10% from $0.52 to $0.57 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2016. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, $133 billion of the share repurchase program has been utilized. The Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\n\nThe following table presents the Company\u2019s dividends, dividend equivalents, share repurchases and net share settlement activity from the start of the capital return program in August 2012 through \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n (in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\nDividends\u00a0and\n\nDividend Equivalents\u00a0Paid\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccelerated\u00a0Share\n\nRepurchases\n\n\u00a0\n\nOpen Market\n\nShare Repurchases\n\n\u00a0\n\nTaxes\u00a0Related to\u00a0Settlement\u00a0\n\nof Equity Awards\n\n\u00a0\n\nTotal\n\n2016\n\n$\n\n12,150\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n12,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n17,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,570\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n42,720\n\n2015\n\n11,561\n\n\u00a0\n\n6,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n30,026\n\n\u00a0\n\n1,499\n\n\u00a0\n\n49,086\n\n2014\n\n11,126\n\n\u00a0\n\n21,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n24,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n1,158\n\n\u00a0\n\n57,284\n\n2013\n\n10,564\n\n\u00a0\n\n13,950\n\n\u00a0\n\n9,000\n\n\u00a0\n\n1,082\n\n\u00a0\n\n34,596\n\n2012\n\n2,488\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n56\n\n\u00a0\n\n2,544\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n47,889\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n52,950\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n80,026\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n5,365\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n186,230\n\nThe Company expects to execute its capital return program by the end of March 2018 by paying dividends and dividend equivalents, repurchasing shares and remitting withheld taxes related to net share settlement of restricted stock units.

The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. \n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n31\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $28.6 billion.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations were comprised of commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, energy and other obligations.  As of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had other purchase obligations of $6.6 billion.\n\nThe Company\u2019s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had non-current deferred tax liabilities of $26.0 billion. Additionally, as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $7.7 billion and an additional $1.0 billion for gross interest and penalties classified as non-current liabilities. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\n\nIndemnification\n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. \n\nThe Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n32\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u2019s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u201cTPE\u201d) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company\u2019s process for determining ESPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u2019s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u2019s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u2019s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n33\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u2019s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u2019s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u2019s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\n\nThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.\n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or inventory prepayments. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company\u2019s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u2019s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company\u2019s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u2019s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write-downs were recorded.\n\nThe Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders in each case based on projected demand. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded.\n\nWarranty Costs\n\nThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u2019s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n34\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n35",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $4.3 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $78.9 billion and $55.8 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on these instruments are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n to increase by $271 million and $200 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nFurther details regarding the Company\u2019s debt is provided in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, \u201cDebt.\u201d\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and may enter in the future, into non-designated foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company\u2019s practice is to hedge a portion of its material foreign exchange exposures, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n36\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $434 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $342 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2016 Form 10-K | \n\n37"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A. \n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item\u00a07, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Uncertainty about global and regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in\u00a0response to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, government austerity programs, negative financial news, declines in income or asset values and/or other factors. These worldwide and regional economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. Demand also could differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations as a result of currency fluctuations because the Company generally raises prices on goods and services sold outside the U.S. to correspond with the effect of a strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Other factors that could influence worldwide or regional demand include changes in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, unemployment, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn the event of financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial\u00a0markets, additional consolidation of the financial services industry, or significant financial service institution failures, there could be tightening in the credit\u00a0markets, low liquidity and\u00a0extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. This\u00a0could have a number of effects on\u00a0the Company\u2019s business, including the insolvency or financial instability of outsourcing partners or suppliers or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products, resulting in\u00a0product delays; inability of customers, including channel partners, to obtain credit to finance\u00a0purchases of the Company\u2019s products; failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; and restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt. Other income and\u00a0expense also could vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses\u00a0realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments; impairment charges resulting from revaluations of debt and equity\u00a0securities and other investments; changes in interest rates;\u00a0increases or decreases in cash balances; volatility in foreign exchange rates; and changes in fair value of derivative instruments.\u00a0Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic\u00a0uncertainty would increase the risk of the actual amounts realized in the\u00a0future on the Company\u2019s financial instruments differing significantly\u00a0from the fair values currently assigned to them.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services compete in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered and/or has applied to register numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u2019s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n8\n\nThe Company markets certain mobile communication and media devices based on the iOS mobile operating system and also markets related services, including third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships; and the Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone market. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors reduce their selling prices and attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, product breadth and distribution channels than the Company. Because some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and/or experience and a lower cost structure, they may be able to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve iOS and iOS devices in order to maintain their functional and design advantages.\n\nThe Company is the only authorized maker of hardware using macOS, which has a minority market share in the personal computer market. This market has been contracting and is dominated by computer makers using competing operating systems, most notably Windows. In the market for personal computers and accessories, the Company faces a significant number of competitors, many of which have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed customer base. Historically, consolidation in this market has resulted in larger competitors. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. An increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\u2019s existing products. The Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results also depend on its ability to continually improve the Mac platform to maintain its functional and design advantages.\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products. The success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of distributors, carriers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, national and regional retailers and value-added resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone subsidize users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such subsidies will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n9\n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its provisions related to inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently adequate, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional related charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. A number of suppliers of components may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u201d\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if those suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The supply of components for a new or existing product could be delayed or constrained, or a key manufacturing vendor could delay shipments of completed products to the Company.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by a few outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\n\nThe Company relies on sole-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many critical components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the net realizable value of these assets could be negatively impacted.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n10\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may experience quality problems from time to time that can result in decreased sales and operating margin and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company sells complex hardware and software products and services that can contain design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain \u201cbugs\u201d that can unexpectedly interfere with the software\u2019s intended operation. The Company\u2019s online services may from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware, software and services it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenue, significant warranty and other expenses and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nWith respect to its Mac products, the Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software for the Company\u2019s products compared to Windows-based products. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of Mac sales and the costs of developing such applications and services. If the Company\u2019s minority share of the global personal computer market causes developers to question the Mac\u2019s prospects, developers could be less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s Mac products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market.\n\nWith respect to iOS devices, the Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications, including applications distributed through the App Store. iOS devices are subject to rapid technological change, and, if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not successfully operate and may result in dissatisfied customers. As with applications for the Company\u2019s Mac products, the availability and development of these applications also depend on developers\u2019 perceptions and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining or upgrading software for the Company\u2019s iOS devices rather than its competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s iOS devices may suffer.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n11\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights.\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\n\nClaims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses.\n\nIn management\u2019s opinion, there is not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.\n\nAlthough management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities including, but not limited to, in areas of labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.\n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u2019s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u2019s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n12\n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to the Company\u2019s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to the risks of international operations.\n\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s brand, international growth efforts and business.\n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs and political instability. Margins on sales of the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, pose risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity, as well as the Company\u2019s inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation, the Company\u2019s failure to manage relationships with its existing retail partners, more challenging environments in managing retail operations outside the U.S., costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of retail inventory, and the Company\u2019s inability to obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u2019s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n13\n\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including, among other things, personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures may not be effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information may still occur, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n14\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, public health issues, natural disasters and other business interruptions.\n\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its suppliers, logistics providers, manufacturing vendors and customers, including channel partners. The Company\u2019s business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond its control. Such events could decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to make and deliver products to its customers, including channel partners, or to receive components from its suppliers, and create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply chain. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The majority of the Company\u2019s R&D activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are in locations that could be affected by natural disasters. In the event of a natural disaster, the Company could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations.\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products and distribution channels. The Company\u2019s software, accessories, and service and support contracts generally have higher gross margins than certain of the Company\u2019s other products. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty, and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u2019s direct sales generally have higher associated gross margins than its indirect sales through its channel partners. In addition, the Company\u2019s gross margin and operating margin percentages, as well as overall profitability, may be materially adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic or channel mix, component cost increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, price competition, or the introduction of new products, including those that have higher cost structures with flat or reduced pricing.\n\nThe Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products, issues with new product introductions, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n15\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. Margins on sales of the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise local prices to fully offset the dollar\u2019s strengthening, or at all, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\n\nGiven the global nature of its business, the Company has both domestic and international investments. Credit ratings and pricing of the Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party financing arrangements or credit insurance. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectability risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.",
        "item7": ">Item 7. \n\nManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThis section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nOverview and Highlights\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories, networking solutions and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store and Apple Music (collectively \u201cDigital Content and Services\u201d). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\nFiscal Period\n\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks and ended on \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n. A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2016 and 2015 ended on \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n, respectively, and spanned 52 weeks each.\n\nFiscal 2017 Highlights\n\nNet sales increased 6% or $13.6 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in each of the geographic operating segments, with the exception of Greater China. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2017 compared to 2016. In May 2017, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $250 billion to $300 billion through March 2019. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share beginning in May 2017. During 2017, the Company spent \n\n$33.0 billion\n\n to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of \n\n$12.8 billion\n\n. Additionally, the Company issued $24.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated term debt, \u20ac2.5 billion of euro-denominated term debt and C$2.5 billion of Canadian dollar-denominated term debt during 2017.\n\nFiscal 2016 Highlights\n\nNet sales declined 8% or $18.1 billion during 2016 compared to 2015, primarily driven by a year-over-year decrease in iPhone net sales and the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in Services. In April 2016, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the expected total size of the program from $200 billion to $250 billion through March 2018.

The foregoing statement regarding the Company\u2019s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of \n\n2018\n\n is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the cost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\u2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\u2019s significant international operations, its financial condition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for \n\n2017\n\n, \n\n2016\n\n and \n\n2015\n\n were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\nResearch and development\n\n$\n\n11,581\n\n\u00a0\n\n15\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n10,045\n\n\u00a0\n\n25\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,067\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n3\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n$\n\n15,261\n\n\u00a0\n\n8\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n14,194\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n14,329\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n7\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n7\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n6\n\n%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n26,842\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n24,239\n\n\u00a0\n\n8\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n22,396\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n12\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n10\n\n%\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2017 and 2016 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to lower discretionary expenditures and advertising costs, partially offset by an increase in headcount-related expenses.\n\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\n\nOther income/(expense), net for \n\n2017\n\n, \n\n2016\n\n and \n\n2015\n\n was as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n$\n\n5,201\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n3,999\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n2,921\n\nInterest expense\n\n(2,323\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1,456\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(733\n\n)\n\nOther expense, net\n\n(133\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1,195\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(903\n\n)\n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n$\n\n2,745\n\n\u00a0\n\n104\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,348\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,285\n\nThe year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange-related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2016 was due primarily to higher interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange-related items. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99%, 1.73% and 1.49% in \n\n2017\n\n, \n\n2016\n\n and \n\n2015\n\n, respectively.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n27\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for \n\n2017\n\n, \n\n2016\n\n and \n\n2015\n\n were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n$\n\n15,738\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n15,685\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n19,121\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n24.6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n25.6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n26.4\n\n%\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rates for \n\n2017\n\n, \n\n2016\n\n and \n\n2015\n\n differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits. The lower effective tax rate in 2016 compared to 2015 was due primarily to greater R&D tax credits.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of $3.9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of \n\n$31.5 billion\n\n. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.\n\nThe IRS concluded its review of the years 2010 through 2012 during the third quarter of 2017. All years prior to 2013 are closed, and the IRS is currently examining the years 2013 through 2015. The Company is also subject to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities.\u00a0In major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 2003 generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the taxing authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\u2019s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. Although Ireland is still computing the recovery amount, the Company expects the amount to be in line with the European Commission\u2019s announced recovery amount of \n\n\u20ac13 billion\n\n, plus interest of \n\n\u20ac1 billion\n\n. Once the recovery amount is finalized by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash. These amounts are expected to be placed into escrow in 2018, where they will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nHedging\n\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRestricted Cash\n\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\u201cASU 2016-18\u201d), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company\u2019s restricted cash balance is not significant.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n28\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company anticipates recording up to $9 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these deferred tax assets are utilized.\n\nStock Compensation\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of awards, and\u00a0classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. Currently, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company\u2019s equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon adoption, the Company will record any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which vesting occurs. As a result, subsequent to adoption the Company\u2019s income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price between the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.\n\nLeases\n\n \n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. While the Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, currently the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities in excess of \n\n$9.5 billion\n\n on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\n \n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments \u2013 Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n \n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.\n\nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No.\u00a02016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (\u201cASU 2016-08\u201d); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing (\u201cASU 2016-10\u201d); ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients (\u201cASU 2016-12\u201d); and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASU 2016-20\u201d). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the \u201cnew revenue standards\u201d).\n\nThe new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n29\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a026, 2015\n\n (in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\n\u00a0\n\n2015\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\n\n$\n\n268,895\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n237,585\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n205,666\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n33,783\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,010\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n22,471\n\nCommercial paper\n\n$\n\n11,977\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,105\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,499\n\nTotal term debt\n\n$\n\n103,703\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n78,927\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n55,829\n\nWorking capital\n\n$\n\n27,831\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,863\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,768\n\nCash generated by operating activities\n\n$\n\n63,598\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n65,824\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n81,266\n\nCash used in investing activities\n\n$\n\n(46,446\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(45,977\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(56,274\n\n)\n\nCash used in financing activities\n\n$\n\n(17,347\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(20,483\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(17,716\n\n)\n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

Additionally, the Company announced that the Board of Directors raised the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, beginning with the dividend paid during the third quarter of 2017. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, \n\n$166 billion\n\n of the share repurchase program had been utilized.

The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, the Company expects to pay \n\n$37.6 billion\n\n under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consisted of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services and other obligations. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, the Company had other purchase obligations of \n\n$6.1 billion\n\n.\n\nThe Company\u2019s other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist primarily of deferred tax liabilities, gross unrecognized tax benefits and the related gross interest and penalties. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, the Company had deferred tax liabilities of \n\n$31.5 billion\n\n, gross unrecognized tax benefits of \n\n$8.4 billion\n\n and an additional \n\n$1.2 billion\n\n for gross interest and penalties. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\n\nIndemnification\n\nAgreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.\n\nThe Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n32\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u2019s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u201cTPE\u201d) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\n\nFor sales of qualifying versions of iOS devices, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company\u2019s process for determining ESPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n33\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u2019s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u2019s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u2019s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u2019s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u2019s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u2019s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\n\nThe Company must purchase components and build inventory in advance of product shipments and has invested in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities. In addition, the Company has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value.\n\nThe industries in which the Company competes are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. In certain circumstances the Company may be required to record additional write-downs of inventory and/or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or inventory prepayments. These circumstances include future demand or market conditions for the Company\u2019s products being less favorable than forecasted, unforeseen technological changes or changes to the Company\u2019s product development plans that negatively impact the utility of any of these assets, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of one or more of the Company\u2019s suppliers that hold any of the Company\u2019s manufacturing-related assets or to whom the Company has made an inventory prepayment. Such write-downs would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results in the period when the additional write-downs were recorded.\n\nThe Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record additional accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its results of operations in the period when the cancellation fees were identified and recorded.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n34\n\nWarranty Costs\n\nThe Company accrues for the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company\u2019s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and the current installed base of products subject to warranty protection to assess the appropriateness of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities could be required and could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to fully recover the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n35",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A. \n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $6.0 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of \n\n$103.7 billion\n\n and \n\n$78.9 billion\n\n, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n to increase by $376 million and $271 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nFurther details regarding the Company\u2019s debt is provided in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 6, \u201cDebt.\u201d\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign-denominated debt issuances. The Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n36\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $434 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the loss in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2017 Form 10-K | \n\n37"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item\u00a07, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item\u00a08, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\n\n.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\n\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and service marks. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating\u00a0the Company\u2019s\u00a0products and infringing on\u00a0its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n8\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their own products or, alternatively, collaborate with each other to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors attempt to imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their individual offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nSome of the markets in which the Company competes, including the market for personal computers, have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company\u2019s existing products.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services in order to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and third-party products in most of its major markets directly to education, enterprise and government customers and consumers and small and mid-sized businesses through its retail and online stores.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs could require a substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n9\n\nThe Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on\u00a0the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \n\n\u201c\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\n\n\u201d\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. Continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements may lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\n\nThe Company relies on single-sourced outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations may be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n10\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply could be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments could be negatively impacted.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects may also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company may be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems could also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and services introductions and lost revenue.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available music, movies, TV shows and books. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n11\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, tablet and personal computer markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices may suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store and TV App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s products include third-party intellectual property, which requires licenses from those third parties. Based on past experience and industry practice, the Company believes such licenses generally can be obtained on reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights\n\n.\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\n\nClaims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in a number of U.S. jurisdictions and before the U.S. International Trade Commission, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation may be expensive, time consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses.\n\nExcept as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n12\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations worldwide, changes to which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations affecting its domestic and international operations in a number of areas.\u00a0These U.S. and foreign laws and regulations affect the Company\u2019s activities in areas including, but not limited to, labor, advertising, digital content, consumer protection, real estate, billing, e-commerce, promotions, quality of services, telecommunications, mobile communications and media, television, intellectual property ownership and infringement, tax, import and export requirements, anti-corruption, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, anti-competition, environmental, health and safety.\n\nBy way of example, laws and regulations related to mobile communications and media devices in the many jurisdictions in which the Company operates are extensive and subject to change. Such changes could include, among others, restrictions on the production, manufacture, distribution and use of devices, locking devices to a carrier\u2019s network, or mandating the use of devices on more than one carrier\u2019s network. These devices are also subject to certification and regulation by governmental and standardization bodies, as well as by cellular network carriers for use on their networks.\u00a0These certification processes are extensive and time consuming, and could result in additional testing requirements, product modifications, or delays in product shipment dates, or could preclude the Company from selling certain products.\n\nCompliance with these laws, regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Any such costs, which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation, could individually or in the aggregate make the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to the Company\u2019s customers, delay the introduction of new products in one or more regions, or cause the Company to change or limit its business practices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to the risks of international operations.\n\nThe Company derives a majority of its revenue and earnings from its international operations. Compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, data privacy and data localization requirements, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the costs of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s brand, international growth efforts and business.\n\nThe Company also could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities including, but not limited to, economic and labor conditions, increased duties, taxes and other costs, political instability and international trade disputes. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries, and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, could be materially adversely affected by international trade regulations, including duties, tariffs and antidumping penalties. The Company is also exposed to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables with customers in certain international markets. There can be no assurance the Company can effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s ability to manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n13\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return of capital and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u2019s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\nThe Company may be subject to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company may also be subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data may be subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company may be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n14\n\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business may be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nInternational trade disputes could result in tariffs and other protectionist measures that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Tariffs could increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs could adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs could also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other protectionist measures that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and protectionist measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures in order to resume operations, and lose significant revenue. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n15\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers.\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time as a result of product transitions, pricing and configuration changes, and component, warranty and other cost fluctuations. The Company\u2019s financial results may be materially adversely impacted as a result of shifts in the mix of products and services that the Company sells; shifts in the geographic, currency or channel mix of the Company\u2019s sales; component cost increases; price competition; or the introduction of new products, including new products with higher cost structures.\n\nThe Company has typically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a majority of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products, issues with new product introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nWeakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n16\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant realized losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.",

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company\u2019s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the \u201cCompany\u201d and \u201cApple\u201d as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\n\nOverview and Highlights\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets mobile communication and media devices and personal computers, and sells a variety of related software, services, accessories and third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s products and services include iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, HomePod, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS operating systems, iCloud, Apple Pay and a variety of other accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications through the iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store, Book Store and Apple Music (collectively \u201cDigital Content and Services\u201d). The Company sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software and various accessories, through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers.\n\nFiscal Period\n\nThe Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.\n\nFiscal 2018 Highlights\n\nNet sales increased 16% or $36.4 billion during 2018 compared to 2017, driven by higher net sales of iPhone, Services and Other Products. Net sales increased year-over-year in each of the geographic reportable segments. \n\nIn May 2018, the Company announced a new capital return program of $100 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.63 to $0.73 per share beginning in May 2018. During 2018, the Company spent \n\n$73.1 billion\n\n to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of \n\n$13.7 billion\n\n.\n\nFiscal 2017 Highlights\n\nNet sales increased 6% or $13.6 billion during 2017 compared to 2016, primarily driven by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac. The year-over-year increase in net sales reflected growth in each of the geographic reportable segments, with the exception of Greater China. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable impact on net sales during 2017.\n\nIn May 2017, the Company announced an increase to its capital return program by raising the total size of the program from $250 billion to $300 billion. This included increasing its share repurchase authorization from $175 billion to $210 billion and raising its quarterly dividend from $0.57 to $0.63 per share beginning in May 2017. During 2017, the Company spent \n\n$33.0 billion\n\n to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of \n\n$12.8 billion\n\n.

The foregoing statement regarding the Company\u2019s expected gross margin percentage in the first quarter of \n\n2019\n\n is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item\u00a01A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and those described in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components and outside manufacturing services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in exchange rates; and costs associated with the Company\u2019s frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for \n\n2018\n\n, \n\n2017\n\n and \n\n2016\n\n were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\nResearch and development\n\n$\n\n14,236\n\n\u00a0\n\n23\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n11,581\n\n\u00a0\n\n15\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n10,045\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n$\n\n16,705\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n15,261\n\n\u00a0\n\n8\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n14,194\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n7\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n7\n\n%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n30,941\n\n\u00a0\n\n15\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n26,842\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n24,239\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n12\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n12\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, infrastructure-related costs and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. R&D expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses and material costs to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2018 was driven primarily by increases in in headcount-related expenses, professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expense in 2017 compared to 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and infrastructure-related costs.\n\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\n\nOther income/(expense), net for \n\n2018\n\n, \n\n2017\n\n and \n\n2016\n\n was as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n$\n\n5,686\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n5,201\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n3,999\n\nInterest expense\n\n(3,240\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(2,323\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1,456\n\n)\n\nOther expense, net\n\n(441\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(133\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1,195\n\n)\n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n$\n\n2,005\n\n\u00a0\n\n(27\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n2,745\n\n\u00a0\n\n104\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n1,348\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in other income/(expense), net during 2018 was due primarily to higher interest expense on debt and the impact of foreign exchange\u2013related items, partially offset by higher interest income. The year-over-year increase in other income/(expense), net during 2017 was due primarily to higher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange\u2013related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 2.16%, 1.99% and 1.73% in \n\n2018\n\n, \n\n2017\n\n and \n\n2016\n\n, respectively.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n27\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for \n\n2018\n\n, \n\n2017\n\n and \n\n2016\n\n were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n$\n\n13,372\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n15,738\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n15,685\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n18.3\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n24.6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n25.6\n\n%\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the \u201c2018 blended U.S. tax rate\u201d). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for \n\n2018\n\n was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rates for \n\n2017\n\n and \n\n2016\n\n were lower than the historical statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes were provided when such earnings were intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.\n\nThe lower effective tax rate in \n\n2018\n\n compared to \n\n2017\n\n was due primarily to the lower 2018 blended U.S. tax rate, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act. The lower effective tax rate in \n\n2017\n\n compared to \n\n2016\n\n was due to a different geographic mix of earnings and higher U.S. R&D tax credits.\n\nAs a result of adopting Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-09, \n\nCompensation \u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-09\u201d), in 2018, the Company records any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for income taxes. The Company anticipates that these excess tax benefits or deficiencies will have the greatest impact on its effective tax rates in the first and third quarters, as the majority of the Company\u2019s equity awards vest in those quarters.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses and tax credits of \n\n$6.3 billion\n\n and deferred tax liabilities of \n\n$426 million\n\n. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance.\n\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to be \n\n\u20ac13.1 billion\n\n, plus interest of \n\n\u20ac1.2 billion\n\n. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals.\n\nOn July 24, 2018, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the U.S. Tax Court's decision in \n\nAltera Corp v. Commissioner\n\n, regarding the inclusion of share-based compensation in cost-sharing arrangements with foreign subsidiaries. The reversal was subsequently withdrawn, and the Company believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the final resolution of the case.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nHedging\n\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued ASU No. 2017-12, \n\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\n\n (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n28\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, \n\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-16\u201d), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Currently, the Company estimates recording $3 billion of net deferred tax assets on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets upon adoption. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual property transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date, as well as the deferred tax impact of the new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized.\n\nLeases\n\n \n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \n\nLeases (Topic 842)\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020. While the Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, based on the lease portfolio as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, the Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $8.9 billion on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company\u2019s lease portfolio as of the adoption date.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\n \n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, \n\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-01\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \n\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\n \n\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \n\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\n\n (\u201cASU 2014-09\u201d), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers.\n\nSubsequently, the FASB issued additional ASUs to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 and its related ASUs are collectively referred to herein as the \u201cnew revenue standard.\u201d The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company will adopt the new revenue standard in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective transition method. The new revenue standard will not have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n29\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the years ended \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a024, 2016\n\n (in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\n\u00a0\n\n2016\n\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities \n\n(1)\n\n$\n\n237,100\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n268,895\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n237,585\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n\n$\n\n41,304\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n33,783\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,010\n\nCommercial paper\n\n$\n\n11,964\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n11,977\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n8,105\n\nTotal term debt\n\n$\n\n102,519\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n103,703\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n78,927\n\nWorking capital\n\n$\n\n14,473\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,831\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,863\n\nCash generated by operating activities \n\n(2)\n\n$\n\n77,434\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n64,225\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n66,231\n\nCash generated by/(used in) investing activities\n\n$\n\n16,066\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(46,446\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(45,977\n\n)\n\nCash used in financing activities \n\n(2)\n\n$\n\n(87,876\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(17,974\n\n)\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n(20,890\n\n)\n\n(1)\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities included \n\n$20.3 billion\n\n that was restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision and other agreements.\n\n(2)\n\nRefer to Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Polices\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the prior period reclassification related to the Company\u2019s adoption of ASU 2016-09.\n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. The Company plans to use current cash and cash generated from ongoing operating activities to fund its share repurchase program and quarterly cash dividend.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, and excludes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for term debt and the deemed repatriation tax payable (in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\nPayments Due \n\nin 2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nPayments Due\n\nin 2020\u20132021\n\n\u00a0\n\nPayments Due\n\nin 2022\u20132023\n\n\u00a0\n\nPayments Due\n\nAfter 2023\n\n\u00a0\n\nTotal\n\nTerm debt\n\n$\n\n8,797\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n18,933\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n17,978\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n58,485\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n104,193\n\nOperating leases\n\n1,298\n\n\u00a0\n\n2,507\n\n\u00a0\n\n1,838\n\n\u00a0\n\n3,984\n\n\u00a0\n\n9,627\n\nManufacturing purchase obligations \n\n(1)\n\n41,548\n\n\u00a0\n\n2,469\n\n\u00a0\n\n1,183\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n45,200\n\nOther purchase obligations\n\n3,784\n\n\u00a0\n\n2,482\n\n\u00a0\n\n681\n\n\u00a0\n\n66\n\n\u00a0\n\n7,013\n\nDeemed repatriation tax payable\n\n\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n5,366\n\n\u00a0\n\n5,942\n\n\u00a0\n\n22,281\n\n\u00a0\n\n33,589\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n55,427\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n31,757\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n27,622\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n84,816\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n199,622\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, substantially all of which is noncancelable.\n\nOperating Leases\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n31\n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.\n\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n\nThe Company\u2019s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\n\nIndemnification\n\nAgreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification of third parties.\n\nThe Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U.S., the U.K. and mainland China. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.\n\nThe Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation and impairment of marketable securities, inventory valuation, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n32\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company\u2019s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company\u2019s standard payment terms, revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions: (i)\u00a0standalone sales of software products, (ii)\u00a0sales of software upgrades and (iii)\u00a0sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware.\n\nFor multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing software essential to the hardware product\u2019s functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the hardware product\u2019s essential software and/or undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables: (i)\u00a0vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (ii)\u00a0third-party evidence of selling price (\u201cTPE\u201d) and (iii)\u00a0best estimate of selling price (\u201cESP\u201d). VSOE generally exists only when the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\n\nFor sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades to the device\u2019s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for the unspecified software upgrade rights or the non-software services, revenue is allocated to these rights and services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services based on the Company\u2019s ESPs is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company\u2019s process for determining ESPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s ESPs and the future rate of related amortization for unspecified software upgrades and non-software services related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services offered, the estimated value of unspecified software upgrade rights and non-software services and the estimated period unspecified software upgrades and non-software services are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\u2019s policy requires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For the Company\u2019s other customer incentive programs, the estimated cost is recognized at the later of the date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company\u2019s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs that could result in reductions to future revenue. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. Management\u2019s estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeems such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n33\n\nValuation and Impairment of Marketable Securities\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments in available-for-sale securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities impact the Company\u2019s net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification of each security\u2019s cost basis. The Company regularly reviews its investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require the Company to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this determination, the Company evaluates, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and the Company\u2019s intent to sell, or whether it will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The Company\u2019s assessment of whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular security, which would have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInventory Valuation, Valuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\n\nThe Company purchases components and builds inventory in advance of product shipments and invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities. In addition, the Company makes prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory. The Company performs a regular review of inventory that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels and component cost trends. If the Company determines inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value, it records a write-down of the inventories. The Company also reviews its manufacturing-related capital assets and inventory prepayments for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an asset is not recoverable, it records an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of such an asset exceeds its fair value. Any write-downs and/or impairments the Company may be required to record would adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company accrues for estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record accruals for cancellation fees that would adversely affect its operating results.\n\nWarranty Costs\n\nThe Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside of the Company\u2019s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of its reported operating results. The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n34\n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets. In the event that the Company determines all or part of its net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance and a corresponding charge to earnings in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Act, which significantly changed U.S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from \n\n35%\n\n to \n\n21%\n\n effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The impact of the Act increased the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes by \n\n$1.5 billion\n\n during 2018. This increase was composed of \n\n$2.0 billion\n\n related to the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and \n\n$1.2 billion\n\n associated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a \n\n$1.7 billion\n\n impact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company\u2019s unrecognized tax benefits. Certain amounts reported by the Company related to the Act are provisional estimates in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Resolution of the Act\u2019s effects different from the assumptions made by the Company could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item\u00a03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 9, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n35\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of \n\n$102.5 billion\n\n and \n\n$103.7 billion\n\n, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n to increase by $399 million and $376 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nFurther details regarding the Company\u2019s debt is provided in Part II, Item\u00a08 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 5, \u201cDebt.\u201d\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nTo provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $485 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a030, 2017\n\n. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2018 Form 10-K | \n\n36"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\n\n.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\n\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on its ability to ensure a continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and emulating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n5\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nSome of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted. In addition, an increasing number of Internet-enabled devices that include software applications and are smaller, simpler and cheaper than traditional personal computers compete with some of the Company\u2019s existing products.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n6\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to \n\n150 days\n\n. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \n\n\u201c\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth\n\n,\u201d\n\n above, also could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n7\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n8\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices may suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales through these platforms. If developers reduce their use of these platforms to distribute their applications and offer in-app purchases to customers, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company could be impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings, such as being found to have infringed on intellectual property rights\n\n.\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new claims may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party.\n\nClaims against the Company based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights have generally increased over time and may continue to increase. In particular, the Company has historically faced a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, litigation can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into licensing agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such disputes. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses.\n\nExcept as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n9\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company\u2019s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company\u2019s business practices or otherwise making the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business and present risks not originally contemplated.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company\u2019s due diligence. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\nThe Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n10\n\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n11\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nInternational trade disputes can result in tariffs and other measures that can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. For example, trade tensions have led to a series of tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures that could limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes and measures could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be adversely affected by more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, gross margins on the Company\u2019s hardware products vary across product lines and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n12\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n13\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables was concentrated within cellular network carriers, and its vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.",

The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.\n\nFiscal \n\n2019\n\n Highlights\n\nTotal net sales \n\ndecreased\n\n \n\n2%\n\n or \n\n$5.4 billion\n\n during 2019 compared to 2018, driven by lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services in all geographic operating segments. The weakness in foreign currencies had a significant unfavorable impact on net sales during 2019.\n\nIn April 2019, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $100 billion to $175 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.73 to $0.77 per share beginning in May 2019. During 2019, the Company repurchased \n\n$67.1 billion\n\n of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of \n\n$14.1 billion\n\n.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n18\n\nProducts and Services Performance\n\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.\n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for \n\n2019\n\n, \n\n2018\n\n and \n\n2017\n\n (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\nNet sales by category:\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\niPhone\n\n\u00a0(1)\n\n$\n\n142,381\n\n\u00a0\n\n(14\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n164,888\n\n\u00a0\n\n18\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n139,337\n\nMac \n\n(1)\n\n25,740\n\n\u00a0\n\n2\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n25,198\n\n\u00a0\n\n(1\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n25,569\n\niPad\n\n\u00a0(1)\n\n21,280\n\n\u00a0\n\n16\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n18,380\n\n\u00a0\n\n(2\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n18,802\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\n(1)(2)\n\n24,482\n\n\u00a0\n\n41\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n17,381\n\n\u00a0\n\n36\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n12,826\n\nServices \n\n(3)\n\n46,291\n\n\u00a0\n\n16\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n39,748\n\n\u00a0\n\n22\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n32,700\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n260,174\n\n\u00a0\n\n(2\n\n)%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n265,595\n\n\u00a0\n\n16\n\n\u00a0%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n229,234\n\n(1)\n\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n\n(2)\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\n\n(3)\n\nServices net sales include sales from the Company\u2019s digital content stores and streaming services, AppleCare, licensing and other services.

Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and remain under downward pressure.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for \n\n2019\n\n, \n\n2018\n\n and \n\n2017\n\n were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n\u00a0\n\n2019\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2018\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange\n\n\u00a0\n\n2017\n\nResearch and development\n\n$\n\n16,217\n\n\u00a0\n\n14\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n14,236\n\n\u00a0\n\n23\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n11,581\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n$\n\n18,245\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n16,705\n\n\u00a0\n\n9\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n15,261\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n7\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n6\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n7\n\n%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n34,462\n\n\u00a0\n\n11\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n30,941\n\n\u00a0\n\n15\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n$\n\n26,842\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n13\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n12\n\n%\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n12\n\n%\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2019 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.

The Act lowered the Company\u2019s U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. By operation of law, the Company applied a blended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 24.5% for 2018 (the \u201c2018 blended U.S. tax rate\u201d). The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the 2018 blended U.S. tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, partially offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Act.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2019 was lower compared to 2018 due primarily to a lower statutory federal income tax rate in 2019 and the impact of the Act in 2018, partially offset by higher taxes on foreign earnings in 2019.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n, the Company had net deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and tax credits of \n\n$14.3 billion\n\n and deferred tax liabilities of \n\n$6.2 billion\n\n. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nHedging\n\nIn August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2017-12, \n\nDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\n\n (\u201cASU 2017-12\u201d). ASU 2017-12 expands component and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging instruments, and eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge ineffectiveness. The Company will adopt ASU 2017-12 in its first quarter of 2020 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the Company\u2019s derivative portfolio and hedging strategies, the adoption of ASU 2017-12 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \n\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first quarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. Based on the composition of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, current market conditions, and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n22\n\nLeases\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \n\nLeases (Topic 842)\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment at the beginning of its first quarter of 2020.

The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.\n\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n\nThe Company\u2019s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. \n\nThe Company\u2019s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n25\n\nValuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\n\nThe Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company\u2019s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are the key inputs in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.\n\nWarranty Costs\n\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company\u2019s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company\u2019s typical experience. The Company regularly reviews these estimates and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\n\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n26\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $2.8 billion and $4.9 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of \n\n$102.1 billion\n\n and \n\n$102.5 billion\n\n, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n and \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n to increase by $325 million and $399 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $592 million as of \n\nSeptember\u00a029, 2018\n\n. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of \n\nSeptember\u00a028, 2019\n\n due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2019 Form 10-K | \n\n27"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\n\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-K. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company\u2019s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Following the initial outbreak of the virus, the Company experienced disruptions to its manufacturing, supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, resulting in temporary iPhone supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. During the course of the pandemic, the Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, where stores and points of sale have reopened they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely.\n\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of and compliance with protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company\u2019s products and services; the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, a majority of the Company\u2019s supply chain, and its manufacturing and assembly activities, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations could materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 5\n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\n\nA downturn in the economic environment could also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic factors could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company believes it is unique in that it designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance that these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, numerous patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by emulating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection may not be consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors may have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 6\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product and service introductions and transitions.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for iPhone offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There is no assurance that such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts upon renewal of the Company\u2019s agreements with these carriers or in agreements the Company enters into with new carriers.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 7\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nGlobal and regional economic conditions could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and growth,\n\n\u201d above, also could affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. If the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and could experience an unanticipated product defect liability. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, material violations of the supplier code of conduct could occur.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings may have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services may not perform as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so could result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell currently available content. The licensing or other distribution arrangements with these third parties are for relatively short terms and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content in the future. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach. Failure to obtain the right to make third-party digital content available, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There is no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. In addition, certain countries have passed or may propose and adopt legislation that would force the Company to license its digital rights management, which could lessen the protection of content and subject it to piracy and also could negatively affect arrangements with the Company\u2019s content providers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There is no assurance that third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets and Windows for personal computers. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets could make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. If developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices may suffer.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and if third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, third-party applications might not take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences or might not operate correctly and may result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe Company sells and delivers third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications through its platforms and in situations where a developer offers purchases for digital features, services, or goods within an application. If developers reduce their use of the Company\u2019s platforms, including in-app purchases, then the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. There is, however, no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. No assurance can be given that such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses.\n\nExcept as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, including matters related to infringement of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome could result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and could require the Company to change its business practices or limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects including, but not limited to: antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anti-corruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company\u2019s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to government investigations, legal actions and penalties. For example, the Company is subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. In addition, if enacted, legislative and other proposals to further regulate technology companies could result in changes to the Company\u2019s business, including requiring the Company to modify its product and service offerings, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to invest in strategic acquisitions, or affecting the Company\u2019s business relationships with other technology companies, and could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Further, the Company\u2019s business partners are or may become subject to litigation that, if resolved against them, could affect the Company\u2019s relationships with these business partners and have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 11\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures or network disruptions.\n\nThe Company is exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThere may be losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personally identifiable information, that could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information including, among other things, personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nFor example, the Company may experience a security breach impacting the Company\u2019s information technology systems that compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information. Such an incident could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage supplier relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including PII, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may, in turn, be used to access the Company\u2019s information technology systems. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, may result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nIn addition to the risks relating to general confidential information described above, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to health data and payment card data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company can be subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company could be subject to litigation or government investigations, may be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and could also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nUnder payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company could be liable for associated investigatory expenses and could also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, financial condition and operating results.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 12\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of PII. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also may restrict transfers of PII among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of PII through its privacy policy, information provided on its website and press statements. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, international trade disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions could harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. International trade disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs may increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including change suppliers, restructure business relationships, and stop offering third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions may be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. Trade restrictions may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding international trade disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company could require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 13\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and operating results to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock price has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes its stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes its stock price should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 14\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a026, 2020, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company could be subject to changes in its tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.",
        "item7": ">Item 7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\u00a028, 2019.\n\nFiscal Year Highlights\n\nCOVID-19 Update\n\nCOVID-19 has spread rapidly throughout the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nDuring 2020, aspects of the Company\u2019s business were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company\u2019s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and the majority of its retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely re-opening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations. \n\nThe full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products.

Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to recover the net deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to evaluate the amount of the valuation allowance, if any, by assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFinancial Instruments\n\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, \n\nFinancial Instruments \u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n\n (\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nContractual Obligations\n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company as of September\u00a026, 2020, and includes amounts already recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, except for manufacturing purchase obligations, other purchase obligations and certain lease obligations (in millions):\n\nPayments due in 2021\n\nPayments due in 2022\u20132023\n\nPayments due in 2024\u20132025\n\nPayments due after 2025\n\nTotal\n\nTerm debt\n\n$\n\n8,750\u00a0\n\n$\n\n20,958\u00a0\n\n$\n\n21,029\u00a0\n\n$\n\n55,341\u00a0\n\n$\n\n106,078\u00a0\n\nLeases\n\n1,622\u00a0\n\n3,097\u00a0\n\n2,352\u00a0\n\n5,888\u00a0\n\n12,959\u00a0\n\nManufacturing purchase obligations \n\n(1)\n\n47,961\u00a0\n\n1,849\u00a0\n\n61\u00a0\n\n40\u00a0\n\n49,911\u00a0\n\nOther purchase obligations\n\n6,178\u00a0\n\n2,736\u00a0\n\n400\u00a0\n\n90\u00a0\n\n9,404\u00a0\n\nDeemed repatriation tax payable\n\n1,533\u00a0\n\n5,923\u00a0\n\n12,955\u00a0\n\n9,254\u00a0\n\n29,665\u00a0\n\nTotal\n\n$\n\n66,044\u00a0\n\n$\n\n34,563\u00a0\n\n$\n\n36,797\u00a0\n\n$\n\n70,613\u00a0\n\n$\n\n208,017\u00a0\n\n(1)\n\nRepresents amount expected to be paid under manufacturing-related supplier arrangements, which are primarily noncancelable.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. The Company\u2019s retail store and other facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain multi-year renewal options. The above contractual obligations table includes future payments under leases that had commenced as of September\u00a026, 2020, and were therefore recorded on the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as leases that had been signed but not yet commenced as of September\u00a026, 2020. Further information regarding the Company\u2019s leases can be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cLeases.\u201d\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, licensing, R&D, Internet and telecommunications services, content creation and other activities.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 26\n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2020, a significant portion of the other non-current liabilities in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the Act. The Company plans to pay the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments in accordance with the Act.\n\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\n\nThe Company\u2019s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.\n\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, valuation of manufacturing-related assets and estimation of inventory purchase commitment cancellation fees, warranty costs, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\u2019s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\n\nThe Company\u2019s process for determining estimated SSPs involves management\u2019s judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. Should future facts and circumstances change, the Company\u2019s SSPs and the future rate of related amortization for product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights related to future sales of these devices could change. Factors subject to change include the nature of the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights offered, their estimated value and the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\n\nValuation of Manufacturing-Related Assets and Estimation of Inventory Purchase Commitment Cancellation Fees\n\nThe Company invests in manufacturing-related assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and prepayments provided to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term agreements to secure the supply of inventory. The Company also accrues estimated purchase commitment cancellation fees related to inventory orders that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled. The Company\u2019s estimates of future product development plans and demand for its products are key inputs in determining the recoverability of manufacturing-related assets and assessing the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accruals. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in estimated demand for one or more of the Company\u2019s products, a change in the Company\u2019s product development plans, or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\u2019s products, the Company may be required to record write-downs or impairments of manufacturing-related assets or accrue purchase commitment cancellation fees.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 27\n\nWarranty Costs\n\nThe Company offers limited warranties on its new and certified refurbished hardware products and on parts used to repair its hardware products, and customers may purchase extended service coverage, where available, on many of the Company\u2019s hardware products. The Company accrues the estimated cost of warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost per claim and knowledge of specific product failures outside the Company\u2019s typical experience. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater-than-50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of GAAP and complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d the Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Except as described in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a026, 2020 and September\u00a028, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $3.1 billion and $2.8 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 28\n\nAs of September\u00a026, 2020 and September\u00a028, 2019, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $107.4 billion and $102.1 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September\u00a026, 2020 and September\u00a028, 2019 to increase by $218 million and $325 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September\u00a026, 2020, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $452 million as of September\u00a028, 2019. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a026, 2020 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2020 Form 10-K | 29"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, can be materially and adversely affected.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nRisks Related to COVID-19\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock, have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. The Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, have been temporarily closed at various times. In many cases, as stores and points of sale have reopened, they are subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers. The Company has at times required substantially all of its employees to work remotely.\n\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 6\n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\n\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Trade and other international disputes can result in tariffs, sanctions, and other measures that restrict international trade and can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s business and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 7\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nBusiness Risks\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences an unanticipated product defect liability from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\n\n\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including healthcare. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services may unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture and maintain its culture, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company also sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 11\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the price of the Company\u2019s stock, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 12\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 13\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive, increasing the cost of conducting the Company\u2019s global operations. Changes to laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and business practices or otherwise making the Company\u2019s products and services less attractive to customers. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\n \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the proposed EU Digital Markets Act, could, if enacted, require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 14\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data is subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nFinancial data, such as payment card data, is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which would materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 16\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K, and can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\u00a026, 2020.\n\nFiscal Year Highlights\n\nCOVID-19 Update\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\n\nDuring 2021, aspects of the Company\u2019s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company\u2019s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company\u2019s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened all of its retail stores and substantially all of its other facilities, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and logistical service providers experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\n\nThe extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d for more information.\n\nFiscal 2021 Highlights\n\nTotal net sales increased 33% or $91.3 billion during 2021 compared to 2020, driven by growth in all Products and Services categories. Year-over-year net sales during 2021 also grew in each of the Company\u2019s reportable segments.\n\nIn April 2021, the Company announced an increase to its current share repurchase program authorization from $225 billion to $315\u00a0billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.205 to $0.22 per share beginning in May 2021. During 2021, the Company repurchased $85.5 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.5 billion.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 20\n\nProducts and Services Performance\n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in millions):\n\n2021\n\nChange\n\n2020\n\nChange\n\n2019\n\nNet sales by category:\n\niPhone\n\n (1)\n\n$\n\n191,973\u00a0\n\n39\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n137,781\u00a0\n\n(3)\n\n%\n\n$\n\n142,381\u00a0\n\nMac \n\n(1)\n\n35,190\u00a0\n\n23\u00a0\n\n%\n\n28,622\u00a0\n\n11\u00a0\n\n%\n\n25,740\u00a0\n\niPad\n\n (1)\n\n31,862\u00a0\n\n34\u00a0\n\n%\n\n23,724\u00a0\n\n11\u00a0\n\n%\n\n21,280\u00a0\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\n(1)(2)\n\n38,367\u00a0\n\n25\u00a0\n\n%\n\n30,620\u00a0\n\n25\u00a0\n\n%\n\n24,482\u00a0\n\nServices \n\n(3)\n\n68,425\u00a0\n\n27\u00a0\n\n%\n\n53,768\u00a0\n\n16\u00a0\n\n%\n\n46,291\u00a0\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n365,817\u00a0\n\n33\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n274,515\u00a0\n\n6\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n260,174\u00a0\n\n(1)\n\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n\n(2)\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod, iPod touch and accessories.\n\n(3)\n\nServices net sales include sales from the Company\u2019s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services.

The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

Products gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Products mix, improved leverage and the strength in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nServices Gross Margin\n\nServices gross margin increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix. Services gross margin percentage increased during 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to a different Services mix and improved leverage, partially offset by higher Services costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n2021\n\nChange\n\n2020\n\nChange\n\n2019\n\nResearch and development\n\n$\n\n21,914\u00a0\n\n17\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n18,752\u00a0\n\n16\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n16,217\u00a0\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n6\u00a0\n\n%\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\n6\u00a0\n\n%\n\nSelling, general and administrative\n\n$\n\n21,973\u00a0\n\n10\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n19,916\u00a0\n\n9\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n18,245\u00a0\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n6\u00a0\n\n%\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\nTotal operating expenses\n\n$\n\n43,887\u00a0\n\n13\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n38,668\u00a0\n\n12\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n34,462\u00a0\n\nPercentage of total net sales\n\n12\u00a0\n\n%\n\n14\u00a0\n\n%\n\n13\u00a0\n\n%\n\nResearch and Development\n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, R&D-related professional services and infrastructure-related costs. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company\u2019s core business strategy.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nThe year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative expense in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, variable selling expenses and professional services.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 23\n\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\n\nOther income/(expense), net (\u201cOI&E\u201d) for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n2021\n\nChange\n\n2020\n\nChange\n\n2019\n\nInterest and dividend income\n\n$\n\n2,843\u00a0\n\n$\n\n3,763\u00a0\n\n$\n\n4,961\u00a0\n\nInterest expense\n\n(2,645)\n\n(2,873)\n\n(3,576)\n\nOther income/(expense), net\n\n60\u00a0\n\n(87)\n\n422\u00a0\n\nTotal other income/(expense), net\n\n$\n\n258\u00a0\n\n(68)\n\n%\n\n$\n\n803\u00a0\n\n(56)\n\n%\n\n$\n\n1,807\u00a0\n\nThe year-over-year decrease in OI&E during 2021 was due primarily to lower interest income and net losses on marketable securities, partially offset by positive fair value adjustments on non-marketable securities and lower interest expense on term debt.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (dollars in millions):\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n$\n\n14,527\u00a0\n\n$\n\n9,680\u00a0\n\n$\n\n10,481\u00a0\n\nEffective tax rate\n\n13.3\u00a0\n\n%\n\n14.4\u00a0\n\n%\n\n15.9\u00a0\n\n%\n\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n\n21\u00a0\n\n%\n\n21\u00a0\n\n%\n\n21\u00a0\n\n%\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to the lower tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of tax settlements, and tax benefits from share-based compensation.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower compared to 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company established deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) for foreign tax credit carryforwards in Ireland and increased DTAs for R&D tax credit carryforwards in California, which resulted in a combined $3.5 billion increase in the valuation allowance on the Company\u2019s DTAs, with no effect on net income. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, together with future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, will be sufficient to realize substantially all of the Company\u2019s remaining DTAs.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $172.6\u00a0billion as of September\u00a025, 2021, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\n\nDebt\n\nAs of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $118.1 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $9.6 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $39.5 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had $6.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 24\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $14.6 billion, with $1.8 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $54.8 billion, with $54.7 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and noncancelable obligations related to advertising, content creation and Internet and telecommunications services. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had other purchase obligations of $8.3 billion, with $4.8 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of September\u00a025, 2021, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was $24.6\u00a0billion, none of which is payable within 12 months.\n\nIn addition to its cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. As of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.22 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 25",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, the Company\u2019s interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a025, 2021 and September\u00a026, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.1 billion and $3.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of September\u00a025, 2021 and September\u00a026, 2020, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $118.7 billion and $107.4 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September\u00a025, 2021 and September\u00a026, 2020 to increase by $186 million and $218 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September\u00a025, 2021, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $551 million as of September\u00a026, 2020. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a025, 2021 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2021 Form 10-K | 27"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates, high unemployment and currency fluctuations can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, energy shortages and cost increases, labor and healthcare costs and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Potential effects include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance operations and purchases of the Company\u2019s products; and insolvency.\n\nA downturn in the economic environment can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other economic factors can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. During the course of the pandemic, certain of the Company\u2019s component suppliers and manufacturing and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that affected sales worldwide, and similar disruptions could occur in the future. Public safety measures can also adversely impact consumer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services in affected areas.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 5\n\nThe Company continues to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company\u2019s operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company\u2019s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products and services. Additional future impacts on the Company may include material adverse effects on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plans, and the Company\u2019s profitability and cost structure.\n\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Trade policies and disputes and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. For example, tensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into making them. These increased costs can adversely impact the gross margin that the Company earns on its products. Tariffs can also make the Company\u2019s products more expensive for customers, which could make the Company\u2019s products less competitive and reduce consumer demand. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer its products and services as designed. These measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed trade restrictions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions of the supply of current products and delays in production ramps of new products.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 7\n\nBusiness Risks\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in Asia, including China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing high demand and shortages of supply, which has adversely affected, and could materially adversely affect, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\n\n\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, the Company\u2019s services from time to time have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment, and/or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences and can operate incorrectly and can result in dissatisfied customers.\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company only retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, could require further changes. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused additional restrictions on production and increased costs for digital content.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 11\n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and could, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores have required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. The Company also has entered into substantial lease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than the Company\u2019s more typical retail stores. Due to the high cost structure associated with the Company\u2019s retail stores, a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of an individual store or multiple stores, including as a result of protective public safety measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and severance costs.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macro-economic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 12\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 10, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and can require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, and climate change.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 13\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be delayed or prohibited from importation, either of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through its environmental, social and governance report, its other non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\n \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market and legal conditions. The Company may make further business changes in the future. New legislative initiatives, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, could require further changes. These changes could include how and to what extent the Company charges developers for access to its platforms and manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store.\n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and apps, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 14\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers could be materially adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing and incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S. and Ireland. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 16\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S. or Ireland, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on all Products and Services net sales during 2022.\n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal 2022 included the following:\n\nFirst Quarter 2022:\n\n\u2022\n\nUpdated MacBook Pro 14\u201d and MacBook Pro 16\u201d, powered by the Apple M1 Pro or M1 Max chip; and\n\n\u2022\n\nThird generation of AirPods.\n\nSecond Quarter 2022:\n\n\u2022\n\nUpdated iPhone SE with 5G technology;\n\n\u2022\n\nAll-new Mac Studio, powered by the Apple M1 Max or M1 Ultra chip;\n\n\u2022\n\nAll-new Studio Display\u2122; and\n\n\u2022\n\nUpdated iPad Air with 5G technology, powered by the Apple M1 chip.\n\nThird Quarter 2022:\n\n\u2022\n\nUpdated MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13\u201d, both powered by the Apple M2 chip;\n\n\u2022\n\niOS 16, macOS Ventura, iPadOS 16 and watchOS 9, updates to the Company\u2019s operating systems; and\n\n\u2022\n\nApple Pay Later, a buy now, pay later service.\n\nFourth Quarter 2022:\n\n\u2022\n\niPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max;\n\n\u2022\n\nSecond generation of AirPods Pro; and\n\n\u2022\n\nApple Watch Series 8, updated Apple Watch SE and all-new Apple Watch Ultra.\n\nIn April 2022, the Company announced an increase to its Program authorization from $315 billion to $405\u00a0billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share beginning in May 2022. During 2022, the Company repurchased $90.2 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $14.8 billion.\n\nCOVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCertain of the Company\u2019s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in supply shortages. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 20\n\nProducts and Services Performance\n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in millions):\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n2021\n\nChange\n\n2020\n\nNet sales by category:\n\niPhone\n\n (1)\n\n$\n\n205,489\u00a0\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n191,973\u00a0\n\n39\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n137,781\u00a0\n\nMac \n\n(1)\n\n40,177\u00a0\n\n14\u00a0\n\n%\n\n35,190\u00a0\n\n23\u00a0\n\n%\n\n28,622\u00a0\n\niPad\n\n (1)\n\n29,292\u00a0\n\n(8)\n\n%\n\n31,862\u00a0\n\n34\u00a0\n\n%\n\n23,724\u00a0\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\n(1)(2)\n\n41,241\u00a0\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\n38,367\u00a0\n\n25\u00a0\n\n%\n\n30,620\u00a0\n\nServices \n\n(3)\n\n78,129\u00a0\n\n14\u00a0\n\n%\n\n68,425\u00a0\n\n27\u00a0\n\n%\n\n53,768\u00a0\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n394,328\u00a0\n\n8\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n365,817\u00a0\n\n33\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n274,515\u00a0\n\n(1)\n\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\n\n(2)\n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales include sales of AirPods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, HomePod mini and accessories.\n\n(3)\n\nServices net sales include sales from the Company\u2019s advertising, AppleCare, cloud, digital content, payment and other services.

The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation and foreign-derived intangible income deductions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2022 was higher compared to 2021 due primarily to a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulatory guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, and lower tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income deductions and share-based compensation.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $156.4\u00a0billion as of September\u00a024, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations.\n\nDebt\n\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $111.8 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $11.1 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.3 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes (\u201cCommercial Paper\u201d) pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had $10.0 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.3 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 24\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $71.1 billion, with $68.4 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to internet services and content creation. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had other purchase obligations of $17.8 billion, with $6.8 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was $22.0\u00a0billion, with $5.3\u00a0billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a capital return program authorized by the Board of Directors. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.23 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 25",
        "item7a": ">Item 7A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nInterest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management\n\nThe Company regularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and interest rate swaps, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Given the effective horizons of the Company\u2019s risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance these positions will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Further, the recognition of the gains and losses related to these instruments may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and outstanding debt. While the Company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuations, it is most affected by fluctuations in U.S. interest rates. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the fair value of those securities, as well as costs associated with hedging and interest paid on the Company\u2019s debt.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. The Company uses a combination of internal and external management to execute its investment strategy and achieve its investment objectives. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company\u2019s investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based on investment positions as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $4.0 billion and $4.1 billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio, respectively. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments prior to maturity.\n\nAs of September\u00a024, 2022, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes and as of September\u00a025, 2021, the Company had outstanding floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate carrying amount of $110.1 billion and $118.7 billion, respectively. The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its outstanding term debt. Interest rate swaps allow the Company to effectively convert fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate payments into fixed-rate payments. Gains and losses on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instrument. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would cause interest expense on the Company\u2019s debt as of September\u00a024, 2022 and September\u00a025, 2021 to increase by $201 million and $186 million on an annualized basis, respectively.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nIn general, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses on its foreign currency\u2013denominated debt issuances. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 26\n\nTo provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate thousands of random market price paths assuming normal market conditions. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $1.0 billion as of September\u00a024, 2022, compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $550 million as of September\u00a025, 2021. Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, the losses in fair value incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.\n\nActual future gains and losses associated with the Company\u2019s investment portfolio, debt and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of September\u00a024, 2022 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and the Company\u2019s actual exposures and positions.\n\nApple Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K | 27"

        "item1a": ">Item 1A.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Risk Factors\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5\n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\n\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its\u00a0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\n\nBusiness Risks\n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\n\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c\n\nThe Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition,\n\n\u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components\n\n. \n\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\n\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\n\nThe Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer.\n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9\n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.\n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\n\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\n\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11\n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\n\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cCommitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12\n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13\n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\n\nThere can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\n\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\n\nFinancial Risks\n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\n\nThe Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\n\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\n\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\n\nThe Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\nGeneral Risks\n\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility.\n\nThe Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:\n\nFirst Quarter 2023:\n\n\u2022\n\niPad and iPad Pro;\n\n\u2022\n\nNext-generation Apple TV 4K; and\n\n\u2022\n\nMLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.\n\nSecond Quarter 2023:\n\n\u2022\n\nMacBook Pro 14\u201d, MacBook Pro 16\u201d and Mac mini; and\n\n\u2022\n\nSecond-generation HomePod.\n\nThird Quarter 2023:\n\n\u2022\n\nMacBook Air 15\u201d, Mac Studio and Mac Pro;\n\n\u2022\n\nApple Vision Pro\u2122, the Company\u2019s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS\u2122, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and\n\n\u2022\n\niOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company\u2019s operating systems.\n\nFourth Quarter 2023:\n\n\u2022\n\niPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and\n\n\u2022\n\nApple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion.\n\nMacroeconomic Conditions\n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20\n\nSegment Operating Performance\n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions):\n\n2023\n\nChange\n\n2022\n\nChange\n\n2021\n\nNet sales by reportable segment:\n\nAmericas\n\n$\n\n162,560\u00a0\n\n(4)\n\n%\n\n$\n\n169,658\u00a0\n\n11\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n153,306\u00a0\n\nEurope\n\n94,294\u00a0\n\n(1)\n\n%\n\n95,118\u00a0\n\n7\u00a0\n\n%\n\n89,307\u00a0\n\nGreater China\n\n72,559\u00a0\n\n(2)\n\n%\n\n74,200\u00a0\n\n9\u00a0\n\n%\n\n68,366\u00a0\n\nJapan\n\n24,257\u00a0\n\n(7)\n\n%\n\n25,977\u00a0\n\n(9)\n\n%\n\n28,482\u00a0\n\nRest of Asia Pacific\n\n29,615\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n\n%\n\n29,375\u00a0\n\n11\u00a0\n\n%\n\n26,356\u00a0\n\nTotal net sales\n\n$\n\n383,285\u00a0\n\n(3)\n\n%\n\n$\n\n394,328\u00a0\n\n8\u00a0\n\n%\n\n$\n\n365,817\u00a0\n\nAmericas\n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\n\nEurope\n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\n\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3\u00a0billion as of September\u00a030, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nThe Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\n\nDebt\n\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\n\nOther Purchase Obligations\n\nThe Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.\n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\n\nAs of September\u00a030, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was $22.0\u00a0billion, with $6.5\u00a0billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24\n\nCapital Return Program\n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\u00a030, 2023, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\n\nUncertain Tax Positions\n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25",

The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\n\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022 (dollars in millions):\n\nInterest Rate\n\nSensitive Instrument\n\nHypothetical Interest\n\nRate Increase\n\nPotential Impact\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\nInvestment portfolio\n\n100 basis points, all tenors\n\nDecline in fair value\n\n$\n\n3,089\u00a0\n\n$\n\n4,022\u00a0\n\nTerm debt\n\n100 basis points, all tenors\n\nIncrease in annual interest expense\n\n$\n\n194\u00a0\n\n$\n\n201\u00a0\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\n\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September\u00a030, 2023 and September\u00a024, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26"
