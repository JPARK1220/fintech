Coverage options range\nfrom standard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings providing\nunlimited 800 number telephone and electronic technical support across all\nMicrosoft products 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.\n \n     Users have access to Microsoft KnowledgeBase, a library of thousands of\ntechnical articles that is updated regularly with useful information regarding\nMicrosoft products. Microsoft provides access to KnowledgeBase via MSN, America\nOnline, CompuServe(R), GEnie(TM), Prodigy, and the Internet. Additionally, the\nCompany offers two information subscription services: Microsoft TechNet and\nMicrosoft Developer Network.\n \n     As a supplement or alternative to direct support, the Company enhances the\nthird party support channel by providing Microsoft Solutions Providers with\neducation, training, tools, and support. Microsoft Solutions Providers include\nAuthorized Training Centers, which offer advanced product education and\ncertification on Microsoft products; and Authorized Support Centers, which\nprovide a wide spectrum of multinational support, multivendor support, and\nintegration services.\n \nCOMPETITION\n \n     The microcomputer software business is intensely competitive and subject to\nextremely rapid technological change. Microsoft faces formidable competition in\nall areas of its business activity, including competition from many companies\nwhose revenues and resources are much larger than Microsoft's.\n \n     Operating systems.  Microsoft's operating systems products face substantial\ncompetition from a number of sources. Major competitors such as IBM, Apple\nComputer, Digital Equipment Corporation, and others, which are vertically\nintegrated in both software development and hardware manufacture, have developed\noperating systems that they preinstall on computers of their own manufacture.\nMany of these operating system software products are also licensed to third\nparty OEMs for preinstallation on their machines. Microsoft's operating systems\nproducts compete with UNIX-based operating systems from a wide range of\ncompanies including IBM, AT&T, Hewlett Packard, Sun Microsystems, Novell, The\nSanta Cruz Operation, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of\ncomputer platforms and are gaining increasing acceptance as desktop operating\nsystems. As microcomputer technology increasingly moves toward connectivity and\ncommunications, Microsoft's operating systems products will face increased\ncompetition from network server operating systems, such as Novell NetWare, and\n\"middleware\" products such as Lotus Notes from IBM. Microsoft's operating\nsystems products also face constant competition from software pirates who\nunlawfully copy and distribute Microsoft's copyrighted software products.\n \n     Business systems. The Company is a fairly recent entrant into\nenterprise-wide computing solutions. As such, competitors enjoy larger market\nshares and installed bases. Software developers that provide competing server\napplications include Oracle, Sybase, and Informix. There are also several\nsoftware vendors who offer connectivity servers. Additionally, Lotus Development\n(now owned by IBM) has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, which\ncompete with the Company's workgroup products.\n \n     Desktop applications. The Company's competitors include many software\napplication vendors, such as Lotus, Oracle, Claris, and Novell. Some of the\ncompetitors in this arena do not offer products in every major desktop\napplication category (e.g., spreadsheet, word processors, databases, etc.) and\nas a result may be able to more effectively focus their efforts on enhancing\nparticular product offerings.\n \n     Online services. An enormous range of companies, including media\nconglomerates, telephone companies, cable companies, retailers, hardware\nmanufacturers, and software developers, are competing to make online services\nwidely available to computer users. Microsoft's new online services network,\nMSN, faces\n \n                                        9\n##PAGE   12\n \nformidable competition from both established online networks, such as CompuServe\n(owned by H&R Block), Prodigy (owned by IBM and Sears), America Online, and\nothers, and impending entrants, such as a number of new online networks that\nwill be offered by AT&T. MSN and other online networks also face competition\nfrom online services that are offered to users directly via the Internet,\nincluding, in particular, the World Wide Web portion of the Internet.\nAdditionally, Netscape, Adobe, Sun Microsystems, and many other companies offer\nsoftware for Internet servers and for user navigation of the Internet.\n \n     Developer. The Company's developer products compete against offerings from\nSybase, Borland, and many other companies.\n \n     Consumer. Microsoft's Consumer division faces many smaller but focused\ncompetitors, particularly in the areas of entertainment and education. Examples\ninclude Intuit, Broderbund, Electronic Arts, Softkey, The Learning Company,\nDavidson Associates, Voyager, Comptons, Edmark, Sierra On-Line, and Dorling\nKindersley. Still other competitors own branded content, such as Walt Disney and\nLucas Arts. Additionally, as platforms become more powerful, PC-based games will\ncompete head-to-head with games created for proprietary systems such as Nintendo\nand Sega. The Consumer Division's input devices face substantial competition\nfrom computer manufactures, since computers are typically sold with a keyboard\nand mouse, and other manufacturers of these devices.\n \n     The Company believes that the principal competitive factors in marketing PC\nsoftware are the product's reputation, features and functions, ease of use,\nreliability, price relative to performance, timeliness of delivery, and\navailability and quality of support services. There is no assurance that the\nCompany's competitive position will not be adversely affected by one or more of\nthese factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the software industry.\n \nEMPLOYEES\n \n     As of June 30, 1995, the Company employed 17,801 people, 12,193\ndomestically and 5,608 internationally. Of the total, 5,397 were in product\nresearch and development, 9,166 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,639 in\nmanufacturing and distribution, and 1,599 in finance and administration.\nMicrosoft's success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software\nindustry. To date, the Company believes it has been successful in its efforts to\nrecruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to\nbe as successful in the future. None of the Company's employees are subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that relations with its\nemployees are excellent.\n ", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n        OF OPERATIONS\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 1993, 1994, AND 1995\n \n     Microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses, sells, and supports a wide\nrange of software products, including operating system platforms for personal\ncomputers (PCs), workstations, and servers; business and consumer applications\nfor productivity, reference, education, and entertainment; and development\ntools. Microsoft also sells personal computer books and input devices, and is\nengaged in the research and development of online and advanced technology\nsoftware products.\n \n     NET REVENUES\n \n     Microsoft's net revenues grew 24% in the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994\nand 28% in fiscal year 1995. Software license volume (as opposed to price)\nincreases have been the principal factor in Microsoft revenue growth. The\naverage selling price per license has decreased, primarily because of general\nshifts in the sales mix from retail packaged products to licensing programs,\nfrom new products to product upgrades, and from stand-alone desktop applications\nto integrated product suites. Average revenue per license from original\nequipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses and corporate license programs, such as\nMicrosoft Select, is lower than average revenue per license from retail\nversions. Likewise, product upgrades have lower prices than new products. Also,\nprices of integrated suites, e.g., Microsoft Office, are less than the sum of\nthe prices for the individual programs included in these products when such\nprograms are licensed separately.\n \n     Product groups. Microsoft has a platforms product group and an applications\nand content product group.\n \n     Platforms product group revenues were $1.52 billion, $1.83 billion, and\n$2.36 billion in 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n \n     Principal personal systems products have been the MS-DOS and Microsoft\nWindows operating systems. MS-DOS is preinstalled on PCs by most OEMs, and\nrevenues from such licenses increased steadily in both 1994 and 1995. Revenues\nfrom retail upgrade versions of MS-DOS decreased in both 1994 and 1995 after a\nstrong increase in 1993 when the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade was released. There were no\nmajor upgrades of MS-DOS in 1994 or 1995. The Microsoft Windows operating system\nwas an increasingly strong contributor to revenues as the number of new PCs\npreinstalled with Windows increased rapidly during the three-year period.\nWindows units licensed to new users were 15 million, 30 million, and 40 million\nin 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n \n     Business systems products offer an enterprise-wide distributed\nclient/server environment based on the Microsoft Windows NT operating system and\nthe server applications in the Microsoft BackOffice family of products. Revenues\nfrom these products increased strongly in 1994 and 1995.\n \n                                       14\n##PAGE   17\n \n     Revenues from developer products increased steadily in all three years, as\nmore independent software vendors, corporate developers, and solutions\ndevelopers licensed tools to develop software for Windows and Windows NT.\n \n     Applications and content product group revenues were $2.24 billion, $2.82\nbillion, and $3.58 billion in 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n \n     Increases in desktop applications revenues were led by strong sales of\nMicrosoft Office. The Microsoft Office Standard product includes the Microsoft\nExcel spreadsheet, the Microsoft Word word processor, the Microsoft PowerPoint\npresentation graphics program, and a Microsoft Mail client-access license, while\nthe Microsoft Office Professional version also includes the Microsoft Access\ndatabase management system. Sales of stand-alone versions of Microsoft Excel and\nMicrosoft Word decreased in 1994 and 1995 as the sales mix continued to shift to\nintegrated product suites.\n \n     Microsoft Home, a broad range of consumer products, also showed continued\ngrowth. The Microsoft Home brand includes CD-ROM multimedia reference titles and\nsoftware products for home and small office productivity, children's creativity,\nand entertainment. Microsoft also markets the Microsoft Mouse and Microsoft\nNatural Keyboard. Mouse sales were flat during the three-year period, while the\ninitial introduction of the keyboard increased revenues in 1995.\n \n     Sales channels. Microsoft distributes its products primarily through OEM\nlicenses, corporate licenses, and retail packaged products. OEM channel revenues\nare license fees from original equipment manufacturers. Microsoft has three\nmajor geographic sales and marketing organizations: U.S. and Canada, Europe, and\nelsewhere in the world (Other International). Sales of corporate licenses and\npackaged products in these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers.\n \n     OEM channel revenues were $731 million in 1993, $1.18 billion in 1994, and\n$1.65 billion in 1995. The primary source of OEM revenues is the licensing of\noperating systems, particularly MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. As such, OEM\nchannel revenues are highly dependent on PC shipment volume.\n \n     U.S. and Canada channel revenues were $1.37 billion, $1.58 billion, and\n$1.88 billion in 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n \n     Revenues in Europe were $1.26 billion, $1.36 billion, and $1.49 billion in\n1993, 1994, and 1995. Growth rates have been lower in Europe than in other\ngeographic areas due to general economic slowness, higher existing market\nshares, and a more dramatic shift to corporate licensing programs.\n \n     Other International channel revenues were $392 million in 1993, $532\nmillion in 1994, and $924 million in 1995. Growth rates continue to be strong\ndue to customer acceptance of newly localized products, particularly in Japan,\nand early entrance into emerging markets.\n \n     Microsoft's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.\nApproximately 44%, 40%, and 37% of Microsoft's revenues were collected in\nforeign currencies during 1993, 1994, and 1995. Since much of Microsoft's\ninternational manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in\nlocal currencies, the impact of exchange rates on net income is less than on\nrevenues.\n \n     OPERATING EXPENSES\n \n     Cost of revenues. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 16.9%\nin 1993, 16.4% in 1994, and 14.8% in 1995. The percentage decreased due to a\ngreater proportion of licenses to OEMs and corporations, lower disk prices from\nvendors, and a higher proportion of CD-ROM versions. These factors were offset\nsomewhat by increased sales of lower-margin products such as integrated suites\nand upgrades.\n \n     Research and development. Microsoft made substantial investments in R&D in\n1994, and the rate of growth accelerated in 1995. Expense increases resulted\nprimarily from development staff headcount growth and higher levels of\nthird-party development costs in many areas, including development efforts for\nWindows 95 and The Microsoft Network. R&D costs also increased for business\nsystems, consumer systems, desktop applications, and consumer products.\n \n                                       15\n##PAGE   18\n \n     Sales and marketing. The increase in the absolute dollar amount of sales\nand marketing expense in 1995 was due primarily to increased product-specific\nmarketing programs, a Microsoft brand advertising campaign, and continued\nexpansion of Product Support Services. In 1994, sales and marketing expenses\nincreased at a slower rate than revenues due to a concerted performance\norientation at all sales sites.\n \n     General and administrative. Increases in general and administrative\nexpenses in 1994 and 1995 were primarily attributable to higher legal costs and\ngrowth in the computer systems and the number of people necessary to support\noverall increases in the scope of Microsoft's operations.\n \n     NONOPERATING ITEMS\n \n     Interest income, which was $83 million, $104 million, and $193 million in\n1993, 1994, and 1995, increased primarily as a result of a larger investment\nportfolio generated by cash from operations.\n \n     In the fourth quarter of 1995, Microsoft paid a $46 million breakup fee to\nIntuit Inc. in connection with the termination of a planned merger.\n \n     In the third quarter of 1994, Microsoft recorded a $120 million charge to\nreflect the estimated impact of a jury verdict in the Stac Electronics patent\nlitigation and related expenses. In June 1994, Microsoft reached an agreement\nwith Stac to settle the litigation and adjusted its estimate accordingly,\nresulting in a credit of $30 million in the fourth quarter and a net pretax\ncharge of $90 million for 1994.\n \n     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n \n     The effective tax rate increased from 32.0% in 1993 to 33.5% in 1994 and\n33.0% in 1995 primarily because of an increase in the U.S. statutory income tax\nrate.\n \n     NET INCOME\n \n     Net income as a percent of revenues decreased in 1995 due to increased\nrelative research and development, sales and marketing, and general and\nadministrative expenses, offset by the lower relative cost of revenues and the\nhigher relative net nonoperating income. The net income percentage decreased in\n1994, primarily due to the patent litigation charge and increased research and\ndevelopment expenses, offset by the lower relative level of sales and marketing\nexpenses.\n \nFINANCIAL CONDITION\n \n     Microsoft's cash and short-term investments totaled $4.75 billion at June\n30, 1995. The portfolio is diversified among security types, industries, and\nindividual issuers. Microsoft's investments are investment grade and liquid. The\nportfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but\nalso includes foreign currency positions in anticipation of continued\ninternational expansion. Microsoft's portfolio is invested in short-term\nsecurities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment in the\nevent of immediate cash needs. Microsoft has no material long-term debt.\nMicrosoft has $70 million of standby multicurrency lines of credit that support\nforeign currency hedging and international cash management.\n \n     Stockholders' equity at June 30, 1995 exceeded $5.3 billion.\n \n     Cash generated from operations has been sufficient historically to fund\nMicrosoft's investment in research and development activities and facilities\nexpansion. As Microsoft grows, investments will continue in research and\ndevelopment in existing and advanced areas of technology. Microsoft's cash will\nalso be used to acquire technology and to fund ventures and other strategic\nopportunities. Additions to property, plant, and equipment are expected to\ncontinue, including facilities and computer systems for research and\ndevelopment, sales and marketing, product support, and administrative staff. For\nexample, on June 30, 1995, commitments related to the construction of new\nbuildings approximated $150 million.\n \n     The exercise of stock options by employees provides additional cash. These\nproceeds have been used in Microsoft's open market stock repurchase program\nthrough which Microsoft provides shares for stock option and stock purchase\nplans. This program will continue in 1996.\n \n                                       16\n##PAGE   19\n \n     During 1995, to enhance its stock repurchase program, Microsoft sold equity\nput warrants to independent third parties. These put warrants entitle the\nholders to sell shares of Microsoft common stock to Microsoft on certain dates\nat specified prices.\n \n     Also during 1995, a subsidiary of Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) purchased\na 20% minority interest in the newly formed Microsoft Online Services\nPartnership. TCI contributed $125 million of TCI common stock, and Microsoft\ncontributed the business assets of its online service, The Microsoft Network,\nwhich was in development.\n \n     Management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with\nfunds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating\nrequirements in 1996. Microsoft's cash and short-term investments are also\nmanaged to be available for strategic investment opportunities or other\npotential large-scale cash needs that may arise in pursuit of Microsoft's\nlong-term strategies.\n \n     Microsoft shareholders have also authorized the issuance of up to 100\nmillion shares of preferred stock, which may be used for any proper corporate\npurpose.\n \n     Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock.\n \nOUTLOOK AND UNCERTAINTIES\n \n     Microsoft does not provide forecasts of potential future financial\nperformance. While management of Microsoft is optimistic about Microsoft's\nlong-term prospects, the following issues and uncertainties, among others,\nshould be considered in evaluating its growth outlook.\n \n     Rapid technological change. The personal computer software industry is\ncharacterized by rapid technological change and uncertainty as to the impact of\nemerging areas such as the Internet and online services, the information\nhighway, networked collaboration products, and electronic commerce.\n \n     Long-term investment cycle. Developing and localizing software is expensive\nand the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle.\nMicrosoft's plans for 1996 include significant investments in software research\nand development and related product opportunities from which significant\nrevenues are not anticipated for a number of years. Management expects total\nspending for research and development in 1996 to increase over spending in 1995.\n \n     Customer acceptance. While Microsoft performs extensive usability and beta\ntesting of new products, user acceptance and corporate penetration rates\nultimately dictate the success of development and marketing efforts of products\nsuch as Windows 95, Microsoft Office for Windows 95, or the Microsoft BackOffice\nfamily of products.\n \n     Product ship schedules. Delays in the release of new products can cause\noperational inefficiencies that impact manufacturing and distribution logistics,\nindependent software vendor (ISV) and OEM relationships, and telephone support\nstaffing.\n \n     Prices. Future prices Microsoft is able to obtain for its products may\ndecrease from historical levels depending on competitive market or cost factors.\nPrices of software in Europe are generally higher than in the U.S. to cover\nlocalization costs and higher costs of distribution. Such price uplifts could\nerode in the future.\n \n     Integrated suites. The price of integrated suites such as Microsoft Office,\nis less than the sum of the prices for the individual programs included in this\nproduct when such programs are licensed separately. Revenues from Microsoft\nOffice may continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues.\n \n     Saturation. Product upgrades, enabling users to upgrade from earlier\nversions of Microsoft's products or from competitors' products, have lower\nprices and margins than new products. As the desktop applications market becomes\nsaturated, the sales mix shifts from standard products to upgrade products. This\ntrend is expected to continue.\n \n                                       17\n##PAGE   20\n \n     Channel mix. Average revenue per license is lower from OEM licenses than\nfrom retail versions, reflecting the relatively lower direct costs of operations\nin the OEM channel. An increasingly higher percentage of revenues was achieved\nthrough the OEM channel during 1994 and 1995.\n \n     Corporate licenses. Average revenue per unit from corporate license\nprograms is lower than average revenue per unit from retail versions shipped\nthrough the finished goods channels. Unit sales under corporate licensing\nprograms may continue to increase.\n \n     Cost of revenues. Although cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues\ndecreased in 1994 and 1995, it varies with channel mix and product mix within\nchannels. Changes in channel and product mix, including the potential retail\nupgrade cycle of Windows 95, may increase cost of revenues as a percentage of\nnet revenues in 1996.\n \n     Sales and marketing and support investments. Microsoft's plans for 1996\ninclude continued investments in its sales and marketing and support groups.\nMicrosoft brand advertising is also expected to increase.\n \n     Foreign exchange. A large percentage of Microsoft's sales and costs of\nmanufacturing and marketing are transacted in local currencies. As a result,\nMicrosoft's international results of operations are subject to foreign exchange\nrate fluctuations.\n \n     Intellectual property rights. Microsoft diligently defends its intellectual\nproperty rights, but unlicensed copying of software represents a loss of\nrevenues to Microsoft. While this adversely affects U.S. revenues, revenue loss\nis even more significant outside of the U.S., particularly in certain countries\nwhere laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Throughout the\nworld, Microsoft actively educates consumers on the benefits of licensing\ngenuine products and educates lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate\nwhere intellectual property rights are protected. There can be no assurance that\ncontinued efforts will affect revenues positively.\n \n     Future growth rates. If a substantial number of users upgrade to Windows\n95, revenue growth rates in the initial shipping quarters of 1996 could be at\nrelatively high levels. Revenue growth rates in the comparable quarters of 1997\nmay not approach such levels. As discussed above, operating expenses are\nexpected to increase in 1996. Because of the fixed nature of a significant\nportion of such expenses, coupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth,\noperating margins in 1997 may decrease from those in 1996.\n \n     Litigation. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights, patents, and\ncopyrights is increasing in the PC software industry. In addition, there are\ngovernment regulation and investigation risks along with other general corporate\nlegal risks.\n "}, "1996": {"item1": "Item 1.   Business\n\n\nGENERAL\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (the \"Company\" or \"Microsoft\") was founded as a\npartnership in 1975 and incorporated in 1981.

The pace of change has\nrecently become even greater due to the surge of interest in the Internet, other\nforms of online services, networking generally, and new programming languages,\nsuch as Java.\n\nMost of the Company's software products are developed internally. The Company\nalso purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees\nthird party development for certain products. Internal development enables\nMicrosoft to maintain closer technical control over the products and gives the\nCompany the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most\nimportant and when they should be implemented. The Company has created a\nsubstantial body of proprietary development tools and has evolved development\nmethodologies for creating and enhancing its products. These tools and\nmethodologies are also designed to simplify a product's portability among\ndifferent operating systems, microprocessors, or computers. Product\ndocumentation is generally created internally.\n\nThe Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is\ngetting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in PCs,\nservers, peripherals, and the Internet, without compromising product quality.\nThe Company strives to become as informed as possible at the earliest possible\ntime about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect\nsoftware design.\n\nDuring fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, the Company spent $610 million, $860\nmillion, and $1,432 million, respectively, on product research and development\nactivities. Those amounts represented 13.1%, 14.5%, and 16.5%, respectively, of\nnet revenues in each of those years. The Company is committed to continued high\nexpenditures for research and product development.\n\n\nLOCALIZATION\n\nIn order to best serve the needs of users in foreign countries, Microsoft\n\"localizes\" many of its products to reflect local languages and conventions. In\nFrance, for example, all user messages and documentation are in French and all\nmonetary references are in French francs, and in the United Kingdom, monetary\nreferences are in British pounds and user messages and documentation reflect\ncertain British conventions. Various Microsoft products have been localized into\nmore than 30 languages.\n\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nMicrosoft contracts a substantial portion of its manufacturing activity to third\nparties. Outside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged\nproducts, documentation, and hardware such as mouse pointing devices, keyboards,\nand joysticks. There are other custom manufacturers in the event that outsourced\nmanufacturing becomes unavailable from current sources.\n\nIn recent years the Company's sales mix has shifted to corporate and OEM\nlicenses from packaged products. Online distribution of software may increase in\nthe future. During July 1996, Microsoft sold its domestic manufacturing and\ndistribution operation.\n\nThe Company's remaining manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico and\nIreland. The Irish manufacturing facility replicates disks, assembles other\npurchased parts, and packages final product. The Puerto Rican facility\nmanufactures CD-ROMs, assembles other purchased parts, and packages final\nproduct. Quality control tests are performed on purchased parts, finished disks\nand CD-ROMs, and other products. The chief materials and components used in\nMicrosoft products include disks or CD-ROMs, books, and multicolor printed\nmaterials. The Company is often able to acquire component parts and materials on\na volume discount basis. The Company has multiple sources for raw materials,\nsupplies, and components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       6\n##PAGE   9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nMicrosoft aligns its sales and marketing people with several customer types,\nincluding end-users, organizations and enterprises, and OEMs. The Company's\nsales and marketing staff seeks to build long-term relationships with customers\nof Microsoft products. In addition to the OEM channel, Microsoft has three major\ngeographic sales and marketing organizations: the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and\nelsewhere in the world (Other International).\n\nThe end-user customer unit has responsibility for activities that target\nend-users who make individual buying decisions for the PCs they use at work or\nhome. Most sales and marketing activities aimed at end-user customers are\nperformed by this unit, including developing and administering reseller\nrelationships; reseller sales terms and conditions; channel marketing and\npromotions; end-user marketing programs; support policies; and seminars, events,\nand sales training for resellers. The key products licensed and sold are the\nCompany's desktop operating systems, desktop applications, and interactive media\nproducts.\n\nThe organization customer unit has responsibility for activities that target\ngroups of users in small and medium organizations. The unit works with channel\npartners such as distributors, aggregators, value-added resellers, and Solution\nProviders to provide complete business solutions to this customer segment.

The program, Microsoft\nSelect, offers flexible software acquisition, licensing, and maintenance options\nspecially designed to meet the needs of large multinational organizations.\nTargeted audiences include technology specialists and influential end-users in\nlarge enterprises. Marketing efforts and fulfillment are generally coordinated\nwith the Microsoft network of large account resellers.\n\nSOLUTION PROVIDERS: Microsoft's Solution Providers program is a comprehensive\nsupport relationship with independent organizations that provide network and\nsystem integration, custom development, training, and technical support for\nbusiness computing solutions. The program supports value-added resellers (VARs),\nsystem integrators, consultants, custom application developers, solution\ndevelopers, Internet service and hosting organizations, independent content\nproviders, and sitebuilders (companies that build Web sites for other\ncompanies), as well as technical support and training organizations. Under this\nbusiness partnership strategy, the Company provides sales and product\ninformation, development services, early access to Microsoft products, and\ncustomer support tools including priority telephone support, education, and\nbusiness development support. To ensure high-quality technical services for the\nCompany's products, Microsoft Solution Providers are required to have\nMicrosoft-certified professionals on staff.\n\nCONSULTING SERVICES: The Company's Consulting Services Division assists\ncustomers in using the Company's computer operating systems, applications, and\ncommunications products. The group works with Solution Providers and helps\ncreate enterprisewide computing solutions for large corporate accounts.\n\nDIRECT MARKETING: Microsoft promotes some of its products through direct\nmarketing techniques directed toward existing and potential users of the\nCompany's products. Promotional materials are typically delivered through the\n\n\n\n                                       7\n##PAGE   10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmail, utilizing lists of targeted individuals. Fulfillment of product to the\nend-user is accomplished by either direct shipment or through resellers.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SALES SITES: The Company has established marketing and/or support\nsubsidiaries in more than 60 countries. Sales are generally made by the local\nsales subsidiary, while product is delivered by either the Company's owned or\noutsourced manufacturing operations. In some locations, sales are made directly\nby the Company from the U.S.\n\nThe Company's international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are subject\nto certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as governmental\nregulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nMicrosoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk.\n\n\nOEM CHANNEL\n\nThe Company's operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements\nthat grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of Microsoft's products with\ntheir computers. The Company also markets certain desktop applications and\ninteractive media programs to OEMs under similar arrangements. In addition, the\nCompany markets the Microsoft Mouse and Natural Keyboard to OEMs for\ndistribution to buyers of their computers. In almost all cases, the products are\ndistributed under Microsoft trademarks. The Company has OEM agreements covering\none or more of its products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including\nAST Research, Acer, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, Dell, Fujitsu,\nGateway 2000, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC, Olivetti, Packard Bell, Siemens,\nToshiba, and Vobis.\n\n\nADVERTISING\n\nThe Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.\nAdvertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials are\ntargeted to various end-user segments. The Company utilizes broad consumer media\n(television, radio, and business publications) and trade publications. Microsoft\nhas programs under which qualifying resellers and OEMs are reimbursed for\ncertain advertising expenditures. Microsoft also invests in direct marketing and\ncustomer satisfaction areas. The Company maintains a broad advertising campaign\nemphasizing the Microsoft brand identity.\n\n\nCUSTOMERS\n\nAs described above, Microsoft has four customer types: end-users, organizations,\nenterprises, and OEMs. Most end-users of Microsoft products are individuals in\nbusinesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and at home. These\nend-users obtain Microsoft products primarily through distributors, resellers,\nand OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with their hardware. Notes to\nFinancial Statements (see Item 8) describe customers that represent more than\n10% of the Company's revenues. The Company's practice is to ship its products\npromptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and, consequently,\nbacklog is not significant.\n\n\nPRODUCT SUPPORT\n\nThe Company provides product support coverage options to meet the needs of users\nof Microsoft products. Support personnel are located in various sites in the\nU.S. and in various Microsoft subsidiaries. Certain support is also supplied by\nqualified third-party support organizations.

Microsoft Solution Providers include Authorized\nTraining Centers, which offer advanced product education and certification on\nMicrosoft products; and Authorized Support Centers, which provide a wide\nspectrum of multinational support, multivendor support, and integration\nservices.\n\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe PC software business is intensely competitive and subject to extremely rapid\ntechnological change. Microsoft faces formidable competition in all areas of its\nbusiness activity (including competition from many companies much larger than\nMicrosoft). The extremely rapid pace of technological change constantly creates\nnew opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render\nexisting technologies less valuable. The Company also faces constant\ncompetition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute\nMicrosoft's copyrighted software products.\n\nTHE INTERNET: The Company faces intense competition in the development and\nmarketing of Internet (and intranet) software from a wide variety of companies\nand organizations including IBM, Netscape, Novell, Oracle, O'Reilly, Sun\nMicrosystems, Apache Group, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\n(NCSA), and the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN).\n\nOPERATING SYSTEMS: Microsoft's operating system products face substantial\ncompetition from a wide variety of companies. Major competitors such as IBM,\nApple Computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Sun\nMicrosystems, and others, are vertically integrated in both software development\nand hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they\npreinstall on computers of their own manufacture. Many of these operating system\nsoftware products are also licensed to third party OEMs for preinstallation on\ntheir machines. Microsoft's operating system products compete with UNIX-based\noperating systems from a wide range of companies including IBM, AT&T,\nHewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, The Santa Cruz Operation, and others.\nVariants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained\nincreasing acceptance as desktop operating systems. As PC technology\nincreasingly moves toward connectivity and communications, Microsoft's operating\nsystem products will face increased competition from network server operating\nsystems such as Novell NetWare, Banyan Vines, the many variants of UNIX, OS/2,\n\"middleware\" products such as Lotus Notes from IBM, and intranet servers from\nNetscape and others. In addition, Netscape is seeking to position its browser\nsoftware as a computing platform that would perform many of the functions\nperformed by operating systems from Microsoft and other vendors.\n\nBUSINESS SYSTEMS: The Company is a fairly recent entrant into the business of\nproviding enterprisewide computing solutions. Several competitors enjoy a larger\nshare of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer operating system\nsoftware for mainframes and midrange computers, including IBM, DEC,\nHewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems. Since legacy business systems are\ntypically support-intensive, these competitors also offer substantive support\nservices. Software developers that provide competing server applications for\nPC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, Sybase, and\nInformix. There are also several software vendors who offer connectivity\nservers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies and organizations that\noffer Internet and intranet server software which compete against the Company's\nbusiness systems. Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes\nand cc:Mail, both of which compete with the Company's workgroup and mail\nproducts.\n\nDESKTOP APPLICATIONS: The Company's competitors include many software\napplication vendors, such as IBM (Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Claris), and Corel. IBM\nand Corel have large installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor\nproducts, respectively, and both appear to have adopted aggressive pricing\nstrategies in recent months. Also, IBM and Apple preinstall certain of their\nsoftware products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with\nMicrosoft application software.\n\nONLINE SERVICES: An enormous range of companies, including media conglomerates,\ntelephone companies, cable companies, retailers, hardware manufacturers, and\nsoftware developers, are competing to make online services widely available to\ncomputer users. Microsoft's new online services network, MSN, faces formidable\ncompetition from both established online networks, such as America Online,\nCompuServe, Prodigy, and impending entrants. MSN also faces competition from\nonline services that are offered to users directly via the Internet, including,\nin particular, the World Wide Web.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                       9\n##PAGE   12\n\n\nINTERACTIVE MEDIA: The Company's Interactive Media division faces many smaller\nbut focused competitors, particularly in the areas of entertainment and\neducation. Many of these competitors have strong brand identification.\nConsolidation in this area of software development has made certain competitors\neven stronger. Examples of competitors include Intuit, Broderbund, Electronic\nArts, Softkey (including The Learning Company and Compton's), Voyager, Edmark,\nCUC International (including Sierra On Line and Davidson Associates), and\nDorling Kindersley. Still other competitors own branded content, such as Disney\nand Lucas Arts. Additionally, as platforms become more powerful, PC-based games\nwill compete head-to-head with games created for proprietary systems such as\nNintendo and Sega. Input devices face substantial competition from computer\nmanufacturers, since computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and\nother manufacturers of these devices.\n\nNEWS SERVICES: The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face formidable competition\nfrom another, more established 24-hour cable and Internet news organization,\nCNN. Additionally, the Fox network has announced plans for its own 24-hour cable\nnews service. MSNBC also competes with traditional news media such as\nnewspapers and broadcast TV, and Internet news services.\n\nDEVELOPER: The Company's developer products compete against offerings from\nBorland, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Symantec, and many other companies.\n\nThe Company believes that the principal competitive factors in marketing PC\nsoftware are a product's features and functions, ease of use, reliability, price\nrelative to performance, timeliness of delivery, reputation, and availability\nand quality of support services. There is no assurance that the Company's\ncompetitive position will not be adversely affected by one or more of these\nfactors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of technological\nchange in the software industry.\n\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of June 30, 1996, the Company employed 20,561 people on a full-time basis,\n13,991 domestically and 6,570 internationally. Of the total, 6,861 were in\nproduct research and development, 10,097 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,485\nin manufacturing and distribution, and 2,118 in finance and administration.\nMicrosoft's success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software\nindustry. To date, the Company believes it has been successful in its efforts to\nrecruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to\nbe as successful in the future. None of the Company's employees are subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements. The Company believes relations with its\nemployees are excellent.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.

The Company maintains a broad advertising\ncampaign emphasizing the Microsoft brand identity.\n\nCUSTOMERS\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company's customers include end-users, organizations, enterprises, ISPs,\napplication developers, and OEMs. Most end-users of Microsoft products are\nindividuals in businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and at\nhome. These end-users obtain Microsoft products primarily through distributors,\nresellers, and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with their\nhardware. Notes to Financial Statements (see Item 8) describe customers that\nrepresent more than 10% of the Company's revenue. The Company's practice is to\nship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers\nand, consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\nPRODUCT SUPPORT\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company provides product support coverage options to meet the needs of users\nof Microsoft products. Support personnel are located in various sites in the\nU.S. and around the world. Certain support is also supplied by qualified\nthird-party support organizations.

Microsoft faces formidable competition in all areas of its\nbusiness activity, including competition from many companies much larger than\nMicrosoft. The rapid pace of technological change constantly creates new\nopportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render\nexisting technologies less valuable. The Company also faces constant competition\nfrom software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute Microsoft's copyrighted\nsoftware products.\n\nOPERATING SYSTEMS. Microsoft's operating system products face substantial\ncompetition from a wide variety of companies. Major competitors such as IBM,\nApple Computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Sun\nMicrosystems, and others are vertically integrated in both software development\nand hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they\npreinstall on computers of their own manufacture. Many of these operating system\nsoftware products are also licensed to third-party OEMs for preinstallation on\ntheir machines. Microsoft's operating system products compete with UNIX-based\noperating systems from a wide range of companies including IBM, AT&T, Hewlett-\nPackard, Sun, The Santa Cruz Operation, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a\nwide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as\ndesktop operating systems. As PC technology increasingly moves toward\nconnectivity and communications, Microsoft's operating system products will face\nincreased competition from network server operating systems such as Novell's\nNetWare, Banyan's Vines, the many variants of UNIX, IBM's OS/2, \"middleware\"\nproducts such as IBM's Lotus Notes, and intranet servers from Netscape, IBM,\nSun, and others.\n\nBUSINESS SYSTEMS. The Company is a fairly recent entrant into the business of\nproviding enterprisewide computing solutions. Several competitors enjoy a larger\nshare of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer operating system\nsoftware for mainframes and midrange computers, including IBM, Digital\nEquipment, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Since legacy business systems are typically\nsupport-intensive, these competitors also offer substantive support services.\nSoftware developers that provide competing server applications for PC-based\ndistributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer Associates,\nSybase, and Informix. There are also several software vendors who offer\nconnectivity servers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies and\norganizations that offer Internet and intranet server software which compete\nagainst the Company's business systems. Additionally, IBM has a large installed\nbase of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with the Company's\nworkgroup and mail products.\n\nDESKTOP APPLICATIONS. The Company's competitors include many software\napplication vendors, such as IBM (Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Claris), Corel, and\nlocal application developers in Europe and the Far East. IBM and Corel have\nlarge installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products,\nrespectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, IBM and Apple\npreinstall certain of their software products on various models of their PCs,\ncompeting directly with Microsoft desktop application software.\n\nDEVELOPER TOOLS. The Company's developer products compete against offerings from\nBorland, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun, Sybase, Symantec, and other companies.\n\nNEWS SERVICES. The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face formidable competition\nfrom other 24-hour cable and Internet news organizations such as CNN and Fox\nNews Network. MSNBC also competes with traditional news media such as newspapers\nand broadcast TV and Internet news services.\n\nCONSUMER PLATFORMS. A wide variety of companies develop operating systems for\ninformation appliances, including Apple, Motorola, 3Com, Psion Software, and\nothers. The Company's nascent WebTV offerings and other multimedia consumer\nproducts face competitors such as Sun, Oracle, NetChannel, and others. An\nenormous range of companies, including media conglomerates, telephone companies,\ncable companies, retailers, hardware manufacturers, and software developers, are\ncompeting to make interactive services widely available to the home.\n\nINTERNET PLATFORMS AND SERVICES. The advent of the Internet as a computing,\ncommunication, and collaboration platform as well as a low cost and efficient\ndistribution vehicle increases competition and creates uncertainty as to future\ntechnology directions. The Company faces intense competition in the development\nand marketing of Internet (and intranet) software from a wide variety of\ncompanies and organizations including IBM, Netscape, Novell, Oracle, Sun, and\nmany others. In addition, the very low barriers to entry on the Internet have\nallowed numerous Web-based service companies to build significant businesses in\nareas such as electronic mail, electronic commerce, \n##PAGE\n \nWeb search engines, and information of numerous types. Competitors include\nNetscape, Lycos, Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, CitySearch, and many others.\n\nONLINE SERVICES. Microsoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable\ncompetition from America Online and other online networks, such as CompuServe\n(the sale of which to America Online is pending), Prodigy, and impending\nentrants. Additionally, MSN faces competition from online services that are\noffered to users directly via the World Wide Web.\n\nINTERACTIVE MEDIA. The Company's Interactive Media division faces many smaller\nbut focused and branded competitors, particularly in the areas of entertainment\nand education. Consolidation in this area of software development has made\ncertain competitors even stronger. Competitors include Intuit, Broderbund,\nElectronic Arts, The Learning Company (including Softkey, MECC, and Compton's),\nVoyager, CUC International (including Sierra On Line, Knowledge Adventures, and\nDavidson Associates), and Dorling Kindersley. Still other competitors own\nbranded content, such as Disney and Lucas Arts.\n\nAdditionally, PC-based games are increasingly competing head-to-head against\ngames created for proprietary systems such as Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and\nSega. Input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers,\nsince computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other\nmanufacturers of these devices.\n\nA number of Microsoft's most significant competitors, including IBM, Sun,\nOracle, and Netscape, have jointly embarked upon various technology development\nand marketing initiatives that are intended to increase customer demand for\nproducts from these companies. These initiatives relate in part to efforts to\nmove software from individual PCs to centrally-managed servers. While the likely\ntechnological and business success of such \"thin client\" strategies is currently\nunknown, widespread adoption of such computing systems would present significant\nchallenges to the Company's historical business model.\n\nThe Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of\nthese factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the software industry.\n\n\nEMPLOYEES\n- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of June 30, 1997, the Company employed 22,232 people on a full-time basis,\n15,835 in the U.S. and 6,397 internationally.  Of the total, 8,059 were in\nproduct research and development, 11,074 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,115\nin manufacturing and distribution, and 1,984 in finance and administration.\nMicrosoft's success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain\nqualified employees.  Competition for employees is intense in the software\nindustry.  To date, the Company believes it has been successful in its efforts\nto recruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that it will continue\nto be as successful in the future.  None of the Company's employees are subject\nto collective bargaining agreements.  The Company believes relations with its\nemployees are excellent.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.

Publisher's Resources, Inc. acts as the Company's\nmain fulfillment house in the United States, maintaining the majority of the\ninventory of Microsoft Press(R) books. Books are marketed by independent sales\nrepresentatives and by Microsoft Press sales personnel. Internationally,\nMicrosoft Press has numerous international agreements with publishers for the\nworldwide distribution of its books. Microsoft Press has granted a publisher\nin England the right to distribute English language versions of its books in\nall countries except the United States, Canada, Central and South America, and\ncertain Asian countries. In most cases, Microsoft Press provides each\npublisher with a book's manuscript, and the publisher arranges for its\ntranslation and the printing, marketing, and distribution of the translated\nversion.\n \nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n \n  The PC software industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological\nchange, which requires constant attention to software technology trends and\nshifting consumer demand, and rapid product innovation. The pace of change has\nrecently become even greater due to the surge of interest in the Internet,\nother forms of online services, PC server-based networking, and new\nprogramming languages, such as Java.\n \n  Most of the Company's software products are developed internally. The\nCompany also purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and\noversees third-party development and localization of certain products.\nInternal development enables Microsoft to maintain closer technical control\nover the products and gives the Company the freedom to designate which\nmodifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be\nimplemented. The Company has created a substantial body of proprietary\ndevelopment tools and has evolved development methodologies for creating and\nenhancing its products. These tools and methodologies are also designed to\nsimplify a product's portability among different operating systems,\nmicroprocessors, or computers. Product documentation is generally created\ninternally.\n \n  The Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product\nis getting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in\nPCs, servers, peripherals, and the Internet, without compromising product\nquality. The Company strives to become informed at the earliest possible time\nabout changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software\ndesign.\n \n  In order to best serve the needs of users around the world, Microsoft\n\"localizes\" many of its products to reflect local languages and conventions.\nIn French versions, for example, all user messages and documentation are in\nFrench with monetary references in French francs. Various Microsoft products\nhave been localized into more than 30 languages.\n \n  During fiscal years 1996, 1997, and 1998, the Company spent $1.43 billion,\n$1.93 billion, and $2.50 billion, respectively, on product research and\ndevelopment activities. Those amounts represented 16.5%, 16.9%, and 17.3%,\nrespectively, of revenue in each of those years, excluding funding of joint\nventure activity. The Company is committed to continue high expenditures for\nresearch and product development.\n \nMANUFACTURING\n \n  Microsoft contracts most of its manufacturing activity with third parties.\nOutside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products and\nhardware such as mouse pointing devices, keyboards, and joysticks. There are\nother custom manufacturers in the event that outsourced manufacturing becomes\nunavailable from current sources.\n \n  The Company's manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico and\nIreland. The Irish facility and the Puerto Rico facilities replicate disks.\nMicrosoft outsources its manufacturing of packaged products. Quality control\ntests are performed on purchased parts, finished disks and CD-ROMs, and other\nproducts. The chief materials and components used in Microsoft products\ninclude disks or CD-ROMs, books, and multicolor printed materials. The Company\nis often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount\nbasis. The Company has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and\ncomponents.\n \n                                       7\n##PAGE\n \n  In recent years the Company's sales mix has shifted to OEM and\norganizational licenses from packaged products. Also, online distribution of\nsoftware may increase in the future.\n \nOPERATIONS\n \n  Microsoft manages all product fulfillment, licensing, and logistic services.\nThe company has regional operation centers in Ireland and the Greater Seattle\narea.

Microsoft faces formidable competition in all\nareas of its business activity, including competition from many\n \n                                      10\n##PAGE\n \ncompanies much larger than Microsoft. The rapid pace of technological change\ncontinually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups\nand can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. The Company also\nfaces constant competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and\ndistribute Microsoft's copyrighted software products.\n \n  Operating systems. Microsoft's operating system products face substantial\ncompetition from a wide variety of companies. Major competitors such as IBM,\nApple Computer, Compaq (Digital Equipment Corporation), Hewlett-Packard, Sun\nMicrosystems and others are vertically integrated in both software development\nand hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they\npreinstall on computers of their own manufacture. Many of these operating\nsystem software products are also licensed to third-party OEMs for\npreinstallation on their machines. Microsoft's operating system products\ncompete with UNIX-based operating systems from a wide range of companies\nincluding IBM, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, The Santa Cruz\nOperation, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer\nplatforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems.\nOver the past year the Linux operating system has gained increasing\nacceptance, and leading software developers such as Oracle and Corel have\nannounced that they will develop applications that run on Linux. As PC\ntechnology increasingly moves toward connectivity and communications,\nMicrosoft's operating system products will face increased competition from\nnetwork server operating systems such as Novell's NetWare, Banyan's Vines, the\nmany variants of UNIX, IBM's OS/2, \"middleware\" products such as IBM's Lotus\nNotes, and intranet servers from Netscape, IBM, Sun Microsystems, and others.\n \n  Business systems. The Company is a fairly recent entrant into the business\nof providing enterprise-wide computing solutions. Several competitors enjoy a\nlarger share of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer\noperating system software for mainframes and midrange computers, including\nIBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems. Since legacy business systems are\ntypically support-intensive, these competitors also offer substantive support\nservices. Software developers that provide competing server applications for\nPC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer\nAssociates, Sybase, and Informix. There are also several software vendors who\noffer connectivity servers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies\nand organizations that offer Internet and intranet server software which\ncompete against the Company's business systems. Additionally, IBM has a large\ninstalled base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with the\nCompany's collaboration and e-mail products.\n \n  Desktop applications. The Company's competitors include many software\napplication vendors, such as IBM (Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Filemaker, Inc.),\nCorel, and local application developers in Europe and the Far East. IBM and\nCorel have large installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor\nproducts, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, IBM\nand Apple preinstall certain of their software products on various models of\ntheir PCs, competing directly with Microsoft desktop application software.\n \n  Developer tools. The Company's developer products compete against offerings\nfrom Borland, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Symantec, and\nother companies.\n \n  News services. The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face formidable\ncompetition from other 24-hour cable and Internet news organizations such as\nCNN, CNN Headline News, and Fox News Network. MSNBC also competes with\ntraditional news media such as newspapers and broadcast TV and Internet news\nservices.\n \n  Consumer platforms. A wide variety of companies develop operating systems\nfor information appliances, including Apple, Motorola, 3Com, Psion Software,\nand others. The Company's nascent WebTV offerings and other multimedia\nconsumer products face competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Oracle,\nNetChannel, and others. An enormous range of companies, including media\nconglomerates, telephone companies, cable companies, retailers, hardware\nmanufacturers, and software developers, are competing to make interactive\nservices widely available to the home.\n \n  Internet platforms and services. The advent of the Internet as a computing,\ncommunication, and collaboration platform as well as a low cost and efficient\ndistribution vehicle increases competition and creates uncertainty as to\nfuture technology directions. The Company faces intense competition in the\ndevelopment and\n \n                                      11\n##PAGE\n \nmarketing of Internet (and intranet) software from a wide variety of companies\nand organizations including IBM, Netscape, Novell, Oracle, Real Networks, Sun\nMicrosystems', and many others. In addition, the very low barriers to entry on\nthe Internet have allowed numerous Web-based service companies to build\nsignificant businesses in areas such as electronic mail, electronic commerce,\nWeb search engines, directories, and information of numerous types.\nCompetitors include Netscape, Lycos, Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, CitySearch, and\nmany others.\n \n  Online services. Microsoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable\ncompetition from America Online and other traditional online services as well\nas a vast array of sites on the World Wide Web that offer content of all types\nand email, chat, search and shopping services, among other things.\n \n  Interactive media. The Company's Interactive Media division faces many\nsmaller but focused and branded competitors, particularly in the areas of\nentertainment and education. Consolidation in this area of software\ndevelopment has made certain competitors even stronger. Competitors include\nIntuit, Electronic Arts, The Learning Company (including Softkey, MECC,\nBroderbund, and Compton's), Voyager, Cendant (including Sierra On Line,\nKnowledge Adventures, and Davidson Associates), and Dorling Kindersley. Still\nother competitors own branded content, such as Disney and Lucas Arts.\n \n  Additionally, PC-based games are increasingly competing head-to-head against\ngames created for proprietary systems such as Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and\nSega. Input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers,\nsince computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other\nmanufacturers of these devices.\n \n  A number of Microsoft's most significant competitors, including IBM, Sun\nMicrosystems, Oracle, and Netscape, are collaborating with one another on\nvarious initiatives directed at competition with Microsoft. These initiatives\nrelate in part to efforts to move software from individual PCs to centrally-\nmanaged servers. While the likely technological and business success of such\n\"thin client\" strategies is currently unknown, widespread adoption of such\ncomputing systems would present significant challenges to the Company's\nhistorical business model.\n \n  The Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more\nof these factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the software industry.\n \nEMPLOYEES\n \n  As of June 30, 1998, the Company employed 27,055 people on a full-time\nbasis, 18,425 in the U.S. and 8,630 internationally. Of the total, 10,019 were\nin product research and development, 13,547 in sales, marketing, and support,\n1,142 in manufacturing and distribution, and 2,347 in finance and\nadministration. Microsoft's success is highly dependent on its ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense\nin the software industry. To date, the Company believes it has been successful\nin its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that\nit will continue to be as successful in the future. None of the Company's\nemployees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company\nbelieves relations with its employees are excellent.\n ", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "ITEM 7.

The group is divided\ninto the following customer selling teams: depth and breadth enterprise sales,\nsmall and medium enterprise sales, and education sales. The enterprise sales\ngroup also provides seminars and forums to familiarize enterprises with\ntechnology issues and solutions.\n\n  The depth and breadth enterprise sales group creates the depth and breadth\nlicensing programs, drives systemic improvements for enterprise customers, and\nmanages key enterprise partners, including USWeb, EDS, AT&T, Computer Sciences\nCorporation, and others. The small and medium enterprise customer group has\nresponsibility for activities that target groups of users in small and medium\norganizations. The group works with channel partners such as distributors,\naggregators, value-added resellers, and Solution Providers to provide complete\nbusiness solutions. The group's sales and marketing activities include managing\ntechnical training programs for Solution Providers (described below) and\nchannel resellers and supporting and providing seminars, events, and sales\ntraining for channel partners.\n\n  The small and medium enterprise customer group also runs the Microsoft\nCertified Professional program, which ensures the quality of Microsoft training\nfor individuals and corporations.

The pace of change is\naccelerating, as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the PC toward\nintelligent devices and appliances.\n\n\n                                       7\n##PAGE\n\n  Most of the Company's software products are developed internally. The Company\nalso purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees\nthird-party development and localization of certain products. Internal\ndevelopment enables Microsoft to maintain closer technical control over the\nproducts and gives the Company the freedom to designate which modifications and\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. The\nCompany has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has\nevolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products.\nThese tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product's\nportability among different operating systems, microprocessors, or computing\ndevices. Product documentation is generally created internally.\n\n  The Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is\ngetting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in\nintelligent devices, PCs, servers, and the Internet, without compromising\nproduct quality. The Company strives to become informed at the earliest\npossible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may\naffect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, Microsoft\nprovides to software vendors a range of development, training, testing\nresources, and guidelines for developing applications to software vendors.\n\n  To best serve the needs of users around the world, Microsoft \"localizes\" many\nof its products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the\nquality and usability of the product in international markets. Localizing of a\nproduct might require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and\ntranslating text. In Japanese versions, for example, all user messages and\ndocumentation are in Japanese with monetary references in the Japanese yen.\nVarious Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages.\n\n  During fiscal years 1997, 1998, and 1999, the Company spent $1.86 billion,\n$2.46 billion, and $2.81 billion, respectively, on product research and\ndevelopment activities. Those amounts represented 15.6%, 17.0%, and 15.0%,\nrespectively, of revenue in each of those years, excluding funding of joint\nventure activity. The Company is committed to continue high expenditures for\nresearch and product development.\n\nManufacturing\n\n  Microsoft contracts out most of its manufacturing activity to third parties.\nOutside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products and\nhardware peripherals. There are other custom manufacturers Microsoft could use\nin the event outsourced manufacturing becomes unavailable from current vendors.\n  The Company's remaining manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico\nand Ireland. The Irish facility and the Puerto Rico facilities manufacture CD-\nROMs. Microsoft outsources its manufacturing of packaged products. Quality\ncontrol tests are performed on purchased parts, CD-ROMs, and other products.\nThe chief materials and components used in Microsoft products include CD-ROMs,\nbooks, and multicolor printed materials. The Company is often able to acquire\ncomponent parts and materials on a volume discount basis. The Company has\nmultiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components.\n  The Company's sales mix has shifted to OEM and organizational licenses from\npackaged products. Also, online distribution of software is increasing.\n\nOperations\n\n  Microsoft manages all product fulfillment, licensing, and logistics services.\nThe Company has regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and the\nGreater Seattle area. The regional centers support all operations activities,\nincluding information processing, vendor management, logistics, and related\nsupporting functions by geographical regions.

The Company established\nMicrosoft Licensing Incorporated (MSLI) in Reno, Nevada, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary, which manages the Company's OEM and certain organizational\nlicensing operations.\n\n                                       8\n##PAGE\n\nMarketing and Distribution\n\n  The Company's sales and marketing group seeks to build long-term\nrelationships with customers of Microsoft products. The OEM sales group\nincludes the sales force that works with original equipment manufacturers that\npreinstall Microsoft software on their PCs. In addition to the OEM channel,\nMicrosoft has three major geographic sales and marketing organizations: the\nSouth Pacific and Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and Asia.\n\n Finished Goods Channels\n\n  Distributors and Resellers. The Company licenses and sells its products in\nthe finished goods channels primarily to and through independent non-exclusive\ndistributors and resellers. Distributors include Inacom, Ingram Micro,\nSoftBank, Tech Data, and Merisel.

To become an MCP, a candidate must pass a certification exam\nthat provides a valid and reliable measure of technical proficiency and\nexpertise. MCP exams are developed with the input of professionals in the\nindustry and reflect how Microsoft products are used in organizations\nthroughout the world. The exams are administered by independent organizations\nat more than 1,400 testing centers around the world. MCPs receive access to\ntechnical and product information through an MCP Web site, MSDN Online\nCertified Membership, and invitations to conferences, technical training\nsessions, and special events.

The Company has established marketing and/or\nsupport subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. Product is generally delivered\nby the Company's owned or outsourced manufacturing operations, which are\nlocated in the geographical region in which the product was sold. By\norganizing geographically, the Company is able to provide service to\ninternational channel customers and access to Microsoft professionals located\nin the same region to serve their specific needs. Subsidiaries have the\nresponsibility for selling products to customers, managing licensing programs,\nand providing support to all types of customers based in international\ncountries. Notes to Financial Statements--(see Item 8) describe foreign\noperations and export sales.\n\n  The Company's international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are\nsubject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as\ngovernmental regulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations. Microsoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk.\n\n Product Support\n\n  The Company provides product support coverage options aligned to the\ncustomer segments, partner segments, and communities. Coverage options range\nfrom standard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings\nproviding unlimited 800 number telephone and electronic technical support for\nall Microsoft products 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.

A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted\nwith system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors.\n\n\n                                      10\n##PAGE\n\n Advertising\n\n  The Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.\nAdvertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials\nare targeted to various end-user segments. The Company uses broad consumer\nmedia (television, radio, the Internet, and business publications) and trade\npublications. Microsoft has programs under which qualifying resellers and OEMs\nare reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures.\n\nCustomers\n\n  The Company's customers include consumers, small and medium-sized\norganizations, enterprises, educational institutions, ISPs, application\ndevelopers, and OEMs. Most consumers of Microsoft products are individuals in\nbusinesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and at home. The\nconsumers and organizations obtain Microsoft products primarily through\nresellers and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with their\ncomputing hardware. Notes to Financial Statements (see Item 8) quantify\ncustomers that represent more than 10% of the Company's revenue. The Company's\npractice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from\nits customers and, consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\nCompetition\n\n  The software business is intensely competitive and subject to extremely\nrapid technological change. The Company is faced with the possibility of\nparadigm shifts from PC-based applications to server-based applications or\nWeb-based application hosting services, from proprietary software to open\nsource software, and from PCs to Internet-based devices. A number of\nMicrosoft's most significant competitors, including IBM, Sun Microsystems,\nOracle, and AOL (Netscape), are collaborating with one another on various\ninitiatives directed at competing with Microsoft. These initiatives relate in\npart to efforts to move software from individual PCs to centrally managed\nservers, which would present significant challenges to the Company's\nhistorical business model. Collaborative efforts also include the development\nof new platform technologies that are intended to replicate much of the value\nof Microsoft Windows operating systems. New computing form factors, including\nnon-PC information devices, are gaining popularity and competing with PCs\nrunning Microsoft's software products.\n\n  Microsoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas\nof its current business activity, including competition from many companies\nmuch larger than Microsoft. The rapid pace of technological change,\nparticularly in the area of Internet platforms and services, continually\ncreates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can\nquickly render existing technologies less valuable. The Company also faces\nrelentless competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and\ndistribute Microsoft's copyrighted software products, depriving the Company of\nlarge amounts of revenue on an annual basis.\n\n  Operating Systems. Microsoft's operating system products face substantial\ncompetition from a wide variety of companies. Competitors such as IBM, Apple\nComputer, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and others are vertically\nintegrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have\ndeveloped operating systems that they preinstall on computers of their own\nmanufacture. Many of these operating system software products are also\nlicensed to third-party OEMs for preinstallation on their computers.\nMicrosoft's operating system products compete with UNIX-based operating\nsystems from a wide range of companies, including IBM, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard,\nSun Microsystems, The Santa Cruz Operation, and others.

In the development and\nmarketing of Internet and intranet solutions, major commerce software\ncompetitors provide many different ranges of products and solutions that\ncompete with Microsoft, including IBM, Oracle, AOL (Netscape), Sun\nMicrosystems, Broadvision, and many others.\n\n  Online Services. Microsoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable\ncompetition from AOL (including its CompuServe unit), AT&T, and other\ntraditional online services as well as a vast array of Web sites and portals\nthat offer content of all types and email, calendaring, chat, and search and\nshopping services, among other things. In addition, the ease of entry into\nInternet services has allowed numerous Web-based service companies to build\nsignificant businesses in areas such as e-mail, electronic commerce, Web\nsearch engines, directories, and information of numerous types. Competitors\ninclude AOL, Yahoo, Excite, Lycos, Infoseek, AltaVista, and many others.\n\n  News Services. The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face formidable\ncompetition from other 24-hour cable and Internet news organizations such as\nCNN, CNN Headline News, and Fox News Network. MSNBC also competes with\ntraditional news media such as newspapers, magazines, and broadcast TV.\n\n  Home and Retail. The Company's Home and Retail division faces many smaller\nbut focused and branded competitors, particularly in the areas of hardware,\nlearning, and entertainment. Consolidation in this area of software\ndevelopment has made certain competitors even stronger. Competitors include\nIntuit, Electronic Arts,\n\n                                      12\n##PAGE\n\nMattel (The Learning Company), Hasbro, Logitech, Voyager, Cendant, and Dorling\nKindersley. Still other competitors own branded content, such as Disney and\nLucas Arts.\n\n  Additionally, PC-based games are increasingly competing head-to-head against\ngames created for proprietary systems such as Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and\nSega. Input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers,\nsince computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other\nmanufacturers of these devices.\n\n  The Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more\nof these factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the computing industry.\n\nEmployees\n\n  As of June 30, 1999, the Company employed 31,396 people on a full-time basis,\n21,802 in the United States and 9,594 internationally.

Internationally,\nMicrosoft Press has numerous agreements with publishers for the worldwide\ndistribution of its books. Microsoft Press has granted a publisher in England\nthe right to distribute English language versions of its books in all\ncountries except the United States, Canada, Latin America, and certain Asian\ncountries. In most cases, Microsoft Press provides each publisher with a\nbook's manuscript, and the publisher arranges for its translation and the\nprinting, marketing, and distribution of the translated version.\n\nCustomer Groups\n\n  The enterprise and partner sales group (EPG) has responsibility for\nproviding strategic leadership and creating programs for enterprise customers\nand partners, assisting the field organization. The organization is\nresponsible for coordinating the enterprise strategy by industry, market,\npartner and customer segment. EPG focuses on enterprise solutions including\nlarge and medium organizations enterprise strategy, industry solutions,\nintegrated small organization strategy, anti-piracy, sales processes and\nreadiness; sales and support systems; partner strategy and programs including\nglobal partner management; enterprise services; executive and technical sales\nincluding corporate account technical marketing, industry evangelism and\nexecutive sales events; and global account management. The group also creates\nan integrated end-to-end service continuum for enterprise customers.\n\n  The industry solutions group includes full-service practices for financial\nservices, telecommunications, federal and state and local government, and the\neducational market .\n\n  The network solutions customer group is responsible for introducing the\nCompany's products and technologies to public infrastructure owners and\nInternet Content Providers. The customer group also focuses on embedded and\ndedicated systems. Infrastructure owners include network operators (telephone\ncompanies, cable companies, Internet service providers, etc.) who build, own,\nand operate the public networks.\n\n  The consumer customer group has responsibility for activities that target\nend users that make individual buying decisions for home PCs. Most sales and\nmarketing activities aimed at end-user customers are performed by this group,\nincluding developing and administering reseller relationships; reseller sales\nterms and conditions; channel marketing and promotions; end-user marketing\nprograms; and seminars, events, and sales training for resellers. The customer\ngroup's sub-segments include direct marketing resellers and retailers.\n\nProduct Development\n\n  The software industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological\nchange, which requires constant attention to computing technology trends, and\nshifting consumer demand, and rapid product innovation. The pace of change is\naccelerating, as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the PC\ntoward intelligent devices and appliances.\n\n                                       7\n##PAGE\n\n  Most of the Company's software products are developed internally. The\nCompany also purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and\noversees third-party development and localization of certain products.\nInternal development enables Microsoft to maintain closer technical control\nover the products and gives the Company the freedom to designate which\nmodifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be\nimplemented. The Company has created a substantial body of proprietary\ndevelopment tools and has evolved development methodologies for creating and\nenhancing its products. These tools and methodologies are also designed to\nsimplify a product's portability among different operating systems,\nmicroprocessors, or computing devices. Product documentation is generally\ncreated internally.\n\n  The Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product\nis getting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in\nintelligent devices, PCs, servers, and the Internet, without compromising\nproduct quality. The Company strives to become informed at the earliest\npossible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may\naffect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, Microsoft\nprovides to software vendors a range of development, training, testing\nresources, and guidelines for developing applications to software vendors.\n\n  To best serve the needs of users around the world, Microsoft \"localizes\"\nmany of its products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve\nthe quality and usability of the product in international markets. Localizing\na product might require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes,\nand translating text. In Japanese versions, for example, all user messages and\ndocumentation are in Japanese with monetary references in the Japanese yen.\nVarious Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages.\n\n  During fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, the Company spent $2.60 billion,\n$2.97 billion, and $3.78 billion, respectively, on product research and\ndevelopment activities. Those amounts represented 17.0%, 15.0%, and 16.4%,\nrespectively, of revenue in each of those years, excluding funding of joint\nventure activity. The Company is committed to continue high expenditures for\nresearch and product development.\n\n  In fiscal 2000, Microsoft announced its most significant software research\nand development initiative, Microsoft .NET. The fundamental strategy behind\nMicrosoft .NET is to focus on the shift from individual Web sites or devices\nconnected to the Internet, to constellations of computers, devices, and\nservices that work together to deliver broader, richer solutions. Microsoft's\n .NET strategy includes the delivery of software as a service, built on the XML\nstandard; a new user experience that is accessible across and optimized for a\nwide range of devices; and the creation of new opportunities for developers to\nbuild Internet services and business more easily. Microsoft .NET builds on\nMicrosoft's core businesses, including Windows desktop and server operating\nsystems, enterprise server applications, Microsoft Office, and MSN. Microsoft\nwill offer a range of .NET products and services including Windows.NET--the\nnext generation Windows platform designed with customized applications and\nservices to allow user to control their digital information; MSN.NET--an\nintegrated consumer experience built on the .NET platform to deliver a more\nintegrated and personalized experience; subscription services--a set of\nconsumer-oriented services on the .NET platform that will build on existing\nMicrosoft entertainment, gaming, education, and productivity products;\nOffice.NET-- advanced communications and productivity tools; bCentral.NET--\nsubscription-based services and tools for small and growing businesses\nincluding hosted messaging, commerce services, and customer relationship\nmanagement services; and Visual Studio.NET--XML-based programming model and\ntools, fully supported by MSDN and Windows DNA 2000 servers.\n\nManufacturing\n\n  Microsoft contracts out most of its manufacturing activity to third parties.\nOutside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products and\nhardware peripherals. There are other custom manufacturers Microsoft could use\nin the event outsourced manufacturing becomes unavailable from current\nvendors.\n\n  The Company's remaining manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico\nand Ireland. The Irish facility and the Puerto Rico facilities manufacture CD-\nROMs. Microsoft outsources its manufacturing of packaged\n\n                                       8\n##PAGE\n\nproducts. Quality control tests are performed on purchased parts, CD-ROMs, and\nother products. The chief materials and components used in Microsoft products\ninclude CD-ROMs, books, and multicolor printed materials. The Company is often\nable to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. The\nCompany has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components.\n\n  The Company's sales mix has shifted to OEM and organizational licenses from\npackaged products. Also, online distribution of software is increasing.\n\nOperations\n\n  Microsoft manages all product fulfillment, licensing, and logistics\nservices. The Company has regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore,\nand the Greater Seattle area. The regional centers support all operations\nactivities, including information processing, vendor management, logistics,\nand related supporting functions by geographical regions. The regional center\nin Dublin, Ireland supports the European, African, and Middle East regions,\nthe center in Singapore supports the Asia Pacific region, and the center in\nthe Greater Seattle area supports North and South America. The Company\nestablished Microsoft Licensing Incorporated (MSLI) in Reno, Nevada, a wholly\nowned subsidiary, which manages the Company's OEM and certain organizational\nlicensing operations.\n\nMarketing and Distribution\n\n  The Company's sales and marketing group seeks to build long-term\nrelationships with customers of Microsoft products. The OEM sales group\nincludes the sales force that works with original equipment manufacturers that\npreinstall Microsoft software on their PCs. In addition to the OEM channel,\nMicrosoft has three major geographic sales and marketing organizations: the\nSouth Pacific and Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and Asia.\n\n Finished Goods Channels\n\n  Distributors and Resellers. The Company licenses and sells its products in\nthe finished goods channels primarily to and through independent non-exclusive\ndistributors and resellers. Distributors include Inacom, Ingram Micro,\nSoftBank, Tech Data, and Merisel. Resellers include Software Spectrum,\nCorporate Software & Technology, CompUSA, Software House International,\nSoftmart, ASAP Software Express, and Best Buy. Microsoft has a network of\nfield sales representatives and field support personnel who solicit orders\nfrom distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales\nsupport.\n\n  Enterprise Accounts. The Microsoft Select program offers flexible software\nacquisition, licensing, and maintenance options specially customized to meet\nthe needs of large multinational organizations. Targeted audiences include\ntechnology specialists and influential end users in large enterprises.\nMarketing efforts and fulfillment are generally coordinated with large account\nresellers. The Microsoft Open program is a licensing program that is targeted\nfor small and medium size organizations. It is available through the reseller\nchannel and offers discounts based on initial purchase volumes. The Microsoft\nEnterprise Agreement program is a licensing program designed to provide a\nflexible licensing and service solution tailored to customers making a long-\nterm licensing commitment. The agreements are designed to increase customer\nsatisfaction by simplifying license administration, payment terms, and the\ncontract process.\n\n  Solution Providers. Microsoft's Solution Providers program is a\ncomprehensive support relationship with independent organizations that provide\nnetwork and system integration, custom development, training, and technical\nsupport for business computing solutions. The program supports system\nintegrators, value-added resellers (VARs), consultants, custom application\ndevelopers, solution developers, Internet service and hosting organizations,\nindependent content providers, and site builders (companies that build Web\nsites for other companies), as well as technical support and training\norganizations. Under this business collaboration strategy,\n\n                                       9\n##PAGE\n\nthe Company provides sales and product information, development services,\nearly access to Microsoft products, and customer support tools, including\npriority telephone support, education, and business development support. To\nensure high-quality technical services for the Company's products, Microsoft\nSolution Providers are required to have Microsoft-certified professionals on\nstaff. Microsoft Direct Access is a comprehensive and open program that allows\nindependent technology providers to actively work with Microsoft through the\nMicrosoft Direct Access program online, quarterly briefings, training, and\naction packs.\n\n  Certified Professionals. Microsoft receives certification fees through the\nMicrosoft Certified Professional (MCP) program, a program that provides\ncredentials for those who have demonstrated in-depth knowledge of at least one\nMicrosoft product. To become an MCP, a candidate must pass a certification\nexam that provides a valid and reliable measure of technical proficiency and\nexpertise. MCP exams are developed with the input of professionals in the\nindustry and reflect how Microsoft products are used in organizations\nthroughout the world. The exams are administered by independent organizations\nat more than 1,400 testing centers around the world. MCPs receive access to\ntechnical and product information through an MCP Web site, MSDN Online\nCertified Membership, and invitations to conferences, technical training\nsessions, and special events. Candidates may pass additional Microsoft\ncertification exams to further qualify their skills with Microsoft BackOffice\nproducts, development tools, and desktop applications.\n\n  Consulting Services. Microsoft Consulting Service assists customers in\ndeploying and using the Company's computer operating systems, applications,\nand communications products. The group works with Solution Providers and helps\ncreate enterprise-wide computing solutions for large corporate accounts.\nMicrosoft Consulting Services also works with technology solutions providers\nto enable them to offer a wide range of Microsoft product-related services\nbacked by high levels of technical skill and knowledge.\n\n  International Sales Sites. The Company has established marketing and/or\nsupport subsidiaries in more than 70 countries. Product is generally delivered\nby the Company's owned or outsourced manufacturing operations, which are\nlocated in the geographical region in which the product was sold. By\norganizing geographically, the Company is able to provide service to\ninternational channel customers and access to Microsoft professionals located\nin the same region to serve their specific needs. Subsidiaries have the\nresponsibility for selling products to customers, managing licensing programs,\nand providing support to all types of customers based in international\ncountries. Notes to Financial Statements--(see Item 8) describe foreign\noperations and export sales.\n\n  The Company's international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are\nsubject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as\ngovernmental regulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate\nfluctuations. Microsoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk.\n\n Product Support\n\n  The Company provides product support coverage options aligned to the\ncustomer segments, partner segments, and communities. Coverage options range\nfrom standard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings\nproviding unlimited 800 number telephone and electronic technical support for\nall Microsoft products 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Support offerings\ninclude the Alliance program, tailored for large enterprises running mission-\ncritical applications on Microsoft platforms; the Premier program for\nenterprises and technical account managers needing regular managed support;\nthe Authorized Premier Support for all types of businesses who work jointly\nwith Microsoft and Microsoft Certified Support Center (MCSC) providers; and\nthe Professional program for small organizations, developers and OEMs. The\nPersonal program for home users, which provides free online self-help\nresources and paid assisted phone support.

Additionally, several support\nofferings include Microsoft TechNet and Microsoft Developer Network\ninformation subscription services.\n\n  Support personnel are located in various sites in the United States and\naround the world. Certain support is also supplied by qualified third-party\nsupport organizations.\n\n\n                                      10\n##PAGE\n\n  As a supplement or alternative to direct support, the Company enhances the\nthird-party support channel by providing Microsoft Certified Solution\nProviders with education, training, tools, and support. Microsoft Certified\nSolution Providers include Authorized Training Centers, which offer advanced\nproduct education and certification on Microsoft products; and Authorized\nSupport Centers, which provide a wide spectrum of multinational support,\nmulti-vendor support, and integration services.\n\n OEM Channel\n\n  Microsoft operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements\nthat grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of the Company's products\nwith their computing devices, principally PCs. The Company also markets and\nlicenses certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware\ndevices, and consumer software programs to OEMs under similar arrangements. In\nalmost all cases, the products are distributed under Microsoft trademarks. The\nCompany has OEM agreements covering one or more of its products with virtually\nall of the major PC OEMs, including, Acer, Actebis, Compaq, Dell, eMachines,\nFujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Gateway, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Micron,\nNEC, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also\nconducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors.\n\n Advertising\n\n  The Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.\nAdvertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials\nare targeted to various end-user segments. The Company uses broad consumer\nmedia (television, radio, the Internet, and business publications) and trade\npublications. Microsoft has programs under which qualifying resellers and OEMs\nare reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures. The company has also\nformed an alliance with Best Buy to provide for joint marketing in Best Buy's\nretail stores, online, and through other vehicles to demonstrate and sell MSN\nInternet access and connectivity solutions.\n\nCustomers\n\n  The Company's customers include consumers, small and medium-sized\norganizations, enterprises, dotcoms, educational institutions, ISPs,\napplication developers, and OEMs. Most consumers of Microsoft products are\nindividuals in businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and\nat home. The consumers and organizations obtain Microsoft products primarily\nthrough resellers and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with\ntheir computing hardware. Notes to Financial Statements (see Item 8) quantify\ncustomers that represent more than 10% of the Company's revenue. The Company's\npractice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from\nits customers and, consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\nCompetition\n\n  The software business is intensely competitive and subject to extremely\nrapid technological change. As the company pursues its largest strategic\ninitiative, Microsoft .NET, the Company could experience more intense\ncompetition during the transition from the traditional core businesses to its\nnew products based on the .NET platform. The Company continues to face\nmovements from PC-based applications to server-based applications or Web-based\napplication hosting services, from proprietary software to open source\nsoftware, and from PCs to Internet-based devices. A number of Microsoft's most\nsignificant competitors, including IBM, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and AOL, are\ncollaborating with one another on various initiatives directed at competing\nwith Microsoft. These initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software\nfrom individual PCs to centrally managed servers, which would present\nsignificant challenges to the Company's historical business model. Other\ncompetitive collaborative efforts also include the development of new platform\ntechnologies that are intended to replicate much of the value of Microsoft\nWindows operating systems. New computing form factors, including non-PC\ninformation devices, are gaining popularity and competing with PCs running\nMicrosoft's software products.\n\n                                      11\n##PAGE\n\n  Microsoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas\nof its current business activity, including competition from many companies\nmuch larger than Microsoft. The rapid pace of technological change,\nparticularly in the area of Internet platforms and services, continually\ncreates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can\nquickly render existing technologies less valuable. The Company also faces\nrelentless competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and\ndistribute Microsoft's copyrighted software products, depriving the Company of\nlarge amounts of revenue on an annual basis.\n\n  Operating Systems.  Microsoft's operating system products face substantial\ncompetition from a wide variety of companies. Competitors such as IBM, Apple\nComputer, Sun Microsystems, and others are vertically integrated in both\nsoftware development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating\nsystems that they preinstall on computers of their own manufacture. Many of\nthese operating system software products are also licensed to third-party OEMs\nfor preinstallation on their computers. Microsoft's operating system products\ncompete with UNIX-based operating systems from a wide range of companies,\nincluding IBM, AT&T, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, The Santa Cruz\nOperation, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer\nplatforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems.\nWith an increased attention toward open-source software, the Linux operating\nsystem has gained increasing acceptance. Several computer manufacturers\npreinstall Linux on PC Servers and many leading software developers have\nwritten applications that run on Linux. Microsoft Windows operating systems\nare also threatened by alternative platforms such as those based on Internet\nbrowsing software and Java technology promoted by AOL and Sun Microsystems.\n\n  Business Solutions. The Company competes in the business of providing\nenterprise-wide computing solutions with several competitors who enjoy a\nlarger share of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer\noperating system software for mainframes and midrange computers, including\nIBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems. Since legacy business systems are\ntypically support-intensive, these competitors also offer substantial support\nservices. Software developers that provide competing server applications for\nPC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer\nAssociates, Sybase, and Informix. There are also several software vendors who\noffer connectivity servers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies\nand organizations that offer Internet and intranet server software, that\ncompete against the Company's business systems. Additionally, IBM has a large\ninstalled base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with the\nCompany's collaboration and e-mail products.\n\n  Desktop Applications. The Company's competitors include many software\napplication vendors, such as IBM (Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Filemaker, Inc.), Sun\nMicrosystems, Corel, Qualcomm, and local application developers in Europe and\nAsia. IBM and Corel have large installed bases with their spreadsheet and\nword-processor products, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing\nstrategies. Also, IBM and Apple preinstall certain of their application\nsoftware products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with\nMicrosoft's desktop application software. Additionally, Web-based application\nhosting services provide an alternative to PC-based applications such as\nMicrosoft Office.\n\n  Developer Tools. The Company's developer products compete against offerings\nfrom Borland, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Symantec, and\nother companies.\n\n  Consumer Platforms. A wide variety of companies develop operating systems\nfor information appliances, including Palm, Apple, Motorola, 3Com, Psion\nSoftware, Sun Microsystems, Microworkz, Be, Inc., WindRiver, Symbian and\nothers. The Company's WebTV offerings and other multimedia consumer products\nface competitors such as AOL, Oracle, Liberate Technologies, NetChannel, and\nothers. An enormous range of companies, including media conglomerates,\ntelephone companies, cable companies, retailers, hardware manufacturers, and\nsoftware developers, are competing to make interactive services widely\navailable to the home.\n\n  E-Commerce. Microsoft competes with many companies in the e-commerce\nbusiness and its major components, including business-to-consumer, business-\nto-business, procurement, and supply chain integration. In the development and\nmarketing of Internet and intranet solutions, major commerce software\ncompetitors\n\n                                      12\n##PAGE\n\nprovide many different ranges of products and solutions that compete with\nMicrosoft, including IBM, Oracle, AOL, Sun Microsystems, Broadvision, and many\nothers.\n\n  Online Services. Microsoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable\ncompetition from AOL (including its CompuServe unit), Yahoo, and a vast array\nof Web sites and portals that offer content of all types and e-mail, instant\nmessaging, calendaring, chat, and search and shopping services, among other\nthings. In addition, the ease of entry into Internet services has allowed\nnumerous Web-based service companies to build significant businesses in areas\nsuch as e-mail, electronic commerce, Web search engines, directories, and\ninformation of numerous types. Competitors include AOL, Yahoo, Excite, Lycos,\nInfoseek, AltaVista, and many others. The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face\nformidable competition from other 24-hour cable and Internet news\norganizations such as CNN, CNN Headline News, and Fox News Network. MSNBC also\ncompetes with traditional news media such as newspapers, magazines and\nbroadcast TV.\n\n  Consumer Software and Hardware. The Company's Consumer Group faces smaller,\nbut focused and branded competitors, particularly in the areas of hardware,\nlearning, and entertainment. Consolidation in this area of software\ndevelopment has made certain competitors even stronger. Competitors include\nIntuit, Electronic Arts, Mattel (The Learning Company), Hasbro, Logitech,\nVoyager, Cendant, and Dorling Kindersley. Still other competitors own branded\ncontent, such as Disney and Lucas Arts.\n\n  Additionally, PC-based games and the Company's future Xbox compete and will\ncompete head-to-head against games created for proprietary systems such as\nNintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Sega. Input devices face substantial\ncompetition from computer manufacturers, since computers are typically sold\nwith a keyboard and mouse, and other manufacturers of these devices.\n\n  The Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more\nof these factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the computing industry.\n\nEmployees\n\n  As of June 30, 2000, the Company employed approximately 39,100 people on a\nfull-time basis, 27,000 in the United States and 12,100 internationally. Of\nthe total, 16,000 were in product research and development, 18,200 in sales,\nmarketing, and support, 1,500 in manufacturing and distribution, and 3,400 in\nfinance and administration. Microsoft's success is highly dependent on its\nability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees\nis intense in the software industry. To date, the Company believes it has been\nsuccessful in its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no\nassurance that it will continue to be as successful in the future. None of the\nCompany's employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements. The\nCompany believes relations with its employees are excellent.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.

Microsoft owns 49 percent of Avanade Inc., a joint venture with\nAccenture Ltd, which offers solutions and services based on Windows 2000.\n\nProduct Development\n\nThe software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which\nrequires constant attention to computing technology trends, and shifting\nconsumer demand, and rapid product innovation.  The pace of change is\naccelerating as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the PC toward\nintelligent devices and appliances.\n\nMost of the Company's software products are developed internally.  The Company\nalso purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees\nthird-party development and localization of certain products.  Internal\ndevelopment enables Microsoft to maintain closer technical control over its\nproducts and gives the Company the freedom to designate which modifications and\nenhancements are most important and when they should be implemented.  The\nCompany has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has\nevolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products.\nThese tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product's\nportability among different operating systems, microprocessors, or computing\ndevices.  Product documentation is generally created internally.\n\nThe Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is\ngetting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in\nintelligent devices, PCs, servers, and the Internet, without compromising\nproduct quality.  The Company strives to become informed at the earliest\npossible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may\naffect software design.  Before releasing new software platforms, Microsoft\nprovides to software vendors a range of development, training, testing\nresources, and guidelines for developing applications.\n\nTo best serve the needs of users around the world, Microsoft \"localizes\" many of\nits products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the\nquality and usability of the product in international markets.  Localizing a\nproduct might require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and\ntranslating text.  In Japanese versions, for example, all user messages and\ndocumentation are in Japanese with monetary references in the Japanese yen.\nVarious Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages.\n\nDuring fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the Company spent $2.97 billion, $3.77\nbillion, and $4.38 billion, respectively, on product research and development\nactivities excluding funding of joint venture activity.  Those amounts\nrepresented 15.0%, 16.4%, and 17.3%, respectively, of revenue in each of those\nyears.  The Company is committed to continue high expenditures for research and\nproduct development.\n\nMicrosoft .NET is Microsoft's platform for XML Web services.

Designed with mission-\ncritical performance in mind, they provide enterprises with the agility they\nneed to integrate their systems, applications, and partners through XML Web\nservices, and the flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements.\n\nIn addition to developers creating XML Web services, Microsoft is creating a\ncore set of building block services that perform routine tasks and act as the\nbackbone for developers to build upon.  The first set of XML Web services being\nbuilt, codenamed \"HailStorm\", is a group of user-centric services oriented\naround people, rather than specific devices, networks, or applications.\nHailStorm is based upon the Microsoft Passport user authentication system.  With\nHailStorm, users receive relevant information, as they need it, delivered to the\ndevices they are using, and based on preferences they have established.\n\nClients are PCs, laptops, workstations, phones, handheld computers, Tablet PCs,\ngame consoles, and other smart devices.  These smart clients and devices use\nsoftware that supports XML Web services, which enable users to access their data\nregardless of the location, type, and number of clients used.  Smart clients and\ndevices leverage XML Web services to create .NET experiences that allow users to\naccess information across the Internet and from stand-alone applications in an\nintegrated way.  Some of the products that Microsoft is transitioning into .NET\nexperiences are Office, MSN, bCentral, and Visual Studio .NET.\n\nManufacturing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft contracts out most of its manufacturing activity to third parties.\nOutside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products and\nhardware.

The Company has established marketing and/or support\nsubsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  Product is generally delivered by the\nCompany's owned or outsourced manufacturing operations, which are located in the\ngeographical region in which the product was sold.  By organizing\ngeographically, the Company is able to provide service to international channel\ncustomers and access to Microsoft professionals located in the same region to\nserve their specific needs.  Subsidiaries have the responsibility for selling\nproducts to customers, managing licensing programs, and providing support to all\ntypes of customers based in international countries.\n\nThe Company's international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are subject\nto certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as governmental\nregulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nMicrosoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk.\n\n                                                                     OEM Channel\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that\ngrant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of the Company's products with\ntheir computing devices, principally PCs.

The Notes to Financial Statements (see Item 8) quantify\ncustomers that represent more than 10% of the Company's revenue.  The Company's\npractice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from\nits customers and, consequently, backlog is not significant.\n\nCompetition\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid\ntechnological change.  As the company pursues its largest strategic initiative,\nMicrosoft .NET, the Company could experience more intense competition during the\ntransition from the traditional core businesses to its new products based on the\n .NET platform.  The Company continues to face movements from PC-based\napplications to server-based applications or Web-based application hosting\nservices, from proprietary software to open source software, and from PCs to\nInternet-based devices.  A number of Microsoft's most significant competitors,\nincluding IBM, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and AOL Time Warner, are collaborating\nwith one another on various initiatives directed at competing with Microsoft.\nThese initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual PCs\nto centrally managed servers, which would present significant challenges to the\nCompany's historical business model.  Other competitive collaborative efforts\ninclude the development of new platform technologies that are intended to\nreplicate much of the value of Microsoft Windows operating systems.  New\ncomputing form factors, including non-PC information devices, are gaining\npopularity and competing with PCs running Microsoft's software products.\n\nMicrosoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas of\nits current business activity, including competition from many companies much\nlarger than Microsoft.  The rapid pace of technological change, particularly in\nthe area of Internet platforms and services, continually creates new\nopportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render\nexisting technologies less valuable.  The Company also faces relentless\ncompetition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute Microsoft's\ncopyrighted software products, depriving the Company of large amounts of revenue\non an annual basis.\n\nThe Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of\nthe following factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of\ntechnological change in the computing industry.\n\nDesktop and Enterprise Software and Services\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe Company's competitors include many software application vendors, such as IBM\n(Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Filemaker, Inc.), Sun Microsystems, Corel, Qualcomm, and\nlocal application developers in Europe and Asia.  IBM and Corel have large\ninstalled bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products,\nrespectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies.  Also, IBM and Apple\npreinstall certain of their application software products on various models of\ntheir PCs, competing directly with Microsoft's desktop application software.\nSun Microsystems' Star Office is also very aggressive with its pricing, offering\na free download from the Web or nominal charge for a CD.  Additionally, Web-\nbased application hosting services provide an alternative to PC-based\napplications such as Microsoft Office.\n\nMicrosoft's operating system products face substantial competition from a wide\nvariety of companies.  Competitors such as IBM, Apple Computer, Sun\nMicrosystems, and others are vertically integrated in both software development\nand hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they\npreinstall on their own computers.  Many of these operating system software\nproducts are also licensed to third-party OEMs for preinstallation on their\ncomputers.  Microsoft's operating system products compete with UNIX-based\noperating systems from a wide range of companies, including IBM, Hewlett-\nPackard, Sun\n\n                                      10\n##PAGE\n\nMicrosystems, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer\nplatforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems.\nWith increased attention toward open source software, the Linux operating system\nhas gained increasing acceptance as well. Several computer manufacturers\npreinstall Linux on PC servers and many leading software developers have written\napplications that run on Linux. Microsoft Windows operating systems are also\nthreatened by alternative platforms such as those based on Internet browsing\nsoftware and Java technology promoted by AOL Time Warner and Sun Microsystems.\n\nThe Company competes in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing\nsolutions with several competitors who enjoy a larger share of sales and larger\ninstalled bases.  Many companies offer operating system software for mainframes\nand midrange computers, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun Microsystems.\nSince legacy business systems are typically support-intensive, these competitors\nalso offer substantial support services.  Software developers that provide\ncompeting server applications for PC-based distributed client/server\nenvironments include Oracle, IBM, Computer Associates, Sybase, and Informix.\nThere are also several software vendors who offer connectivity servers.  As\nmentioned above, there are numerous companies and organizations that offer\nInternet and intranet server software, which compete against the Company's\nbusiness systems.  Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes\nand cc:Mail, both of which compete with the Company's collaboration and e-mail\nproducts.\n\nThe Company's developer products compete against offerings from Borland,\nMacromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, Symantec, and other companies.\n\nConsumer Software, Services, and Devices\n----------------------------------------\n\nMicrosoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable competition from AOL\nTime Warner (including its CompuServe unit), Yahoo!, and a vast array of Web\nsites and portals that offer content of all types and e-mail, instant messaging,\ncalendaring, chat, and search and shopping services, among other things.  In\naddition, the ease of entry into Internet services has allowed numerous Web-\nbased service companies to build significant businesses in areas such as e-mail,\nelectronic commerce, Web search engines, directories, and information of\nnumerous types.  Competitors include AOL Time Warner, Yahoo!, Excite, Lycos,\nInfoseek, AltaVista, and many others.  The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face\nconsiderable competition from other 24-hour cable and Internet news\norganizations such as CNN, CNN Headline News, and Fox News Network.  MSNBC also\ncompetes with traditional news media such as newspapers, magazines, and\nbroadcast TV.\n\nThe Company's Consumer Group continues to see consolidation across the various\nentertainment and productivity segments in which Microsoft competes.\nCompetitors include Vivendi (Havas), Intuit, Electronic Arts, The Learning\nCompany, Infogrammes, and Logitech.  Still other competitors own branded\ncontent, such as Disney and LucasArts.\n\nAdditionally, PC-based games and the Company's future Xbox compete and will\ncompete head-to-head against games created for proprietary systems such as the\nNintendo GameCube and the Sony PlayStation.  Game developers like Electronic\nArts, Namco, Midway, Activision, Konami, THQ, to name a few, are both partners\nand competitors in the games software development segment.\n\nMicrosoft faces many competitors in the Mobile Devices space, including Palm,\nSymbian, Nokia, and Openwave.  The embedded operating system market is highly\nfragmented with many competitive offerings.  Key competitors include Wind River\nand versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Red Hat,\nLineo, and Monta Vista.  The largest competitor remains in-house operating\nsystems developed by device manufacturers.  However, this is changing as more\ndevice builders opt for commercial offerings as connectivity and richer features\nare required in devices.\n\n                                      11\n##PAGE\n\nConsumer Commerce Investments\n-----------------------------\n\nIn the United States, Expedia, Inc. competes with traditional travel\ndistribution channels and online travel services such as Travelocity.com, Hotel\nReservations Network, Priceline.com, CheapTickets.com, Biztravel.com,\nWorldres.com, and Trip.com.  Expedia also competes with supplier-owned sites\nsuch as United.com, Delta.com, and Marriott.com.  In addition, two new\ncompetitors owned by various airlines, Orbitz and Hotwire, emerged in fiscal\nyear 2001.  Internationally, Expedia competes with a different set of\nparticipants in each market.  Microsoft faces many competitors in the online\nreal estate service space, including AOL's House and Home channel and Homestore.\nThe Company also faces many competitors in the online automotive service space,\nincluding Autobytel, CarsDirect, AOL autos, and Yahoo! autos.\n\nOther\n-----\n\nPC input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers, since\ncomputers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other manufacturers\nof these devices.  Microsoft Press competes in the retail book and eLearning\nmarkets with publishers that also create content on Microsoft technologies.  A\nfew of the retail competitors are Pearson, WROX, Sybex, and Wiley.  The major\neLearning competitors are Smartforce and NetG.\n\nEmployees\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs of June 30, 2001, the Company employed approximately 47,600 people on a full-\ntime basis, 33,000 in the United States and 14,600 internationally.  Of the\ntotal, 19,400 were in product research and development, 22,500 in sales,\nmarketing, and support, 1,900 in manufacturing and distribution, and 3,800 in\nfinance and administration.  Microsoft's success is highly dependent on its\nability to attract and retain qualified employees.  Competition for employees is\nintense in the software industry.  To date, the Company believes it has been\nsuccessful in its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no\nassurance that it will continue to be as successful in the future.  None of the\nCompany's employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements.  The Company\nbelieves relations with its employees are excellent.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and\n         Financial Condition\n\nResults of Operations for 1999, 2000, and 2001\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMicrosoft develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of\nsoftware products for a multitude of computing devices.  Microsoft software\nincludes scalable operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and\nintelligent devices; server applications for client/server environments;\nknowledge worker productivity applications; and software development tools.  The\nCompany's online efforts include the MSN network of Internet products and\nservices and alliances with companies involved with broadband access and various\nforms of digital interactivity.  Microsoft also licenses consumer software\nprograms; sells hardware devices; provides consulting services; trains and\ncertifies system integrators and developers; and researches and develops\nadvanced technologies for future software products.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are forward-\nlooking.  These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions\nthat are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Actual results could differ\nmaterially because of factors discussed below under \"Issues and Uncertainties.\"\n\n                                                                         Revenue\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Company's revenue growth rate was 29% in fiscal 1999, 16% in fiscal 2000,\nand 10% in fiscal 2001.  Revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by\nlicensing of Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft SQL Server, and the\nother .NET Enterprise Servers.  Consumer Software, Services, and Devices revenue\nalso grew strongly.  Partially offsetting those items was flat revenue growth\nfrom Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) and Windows 98 operating systems,\nreflecting the slowdown in consumer PC shipments and a higher mix of Windows\n2000 Professional and Windows NT Workstation.  Revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was\ndriven by strong licensing of Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Windows 2000\nProfessional, Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Office 2000, and\nSQL Server.  Consumer Software, Services, and Devices revenue also grew\nstrongly.  Partially offsetting those items was slower growth from Windows\noperating systems sold through the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) channel\ndue to slow demand for business PCs throughout a significant portion of fiscal\n2000.  Revenue growth in fiscal 1999 reflected the continued adoption of Windows\noperating systems and Microsoft Office.  In addition, the Company's estimate for\nfuture product returns was reduced by $250 million in fiscal 1999.\n\nIn fiscal 1999, Microsoft made two changes related to the ratable recognition of\nrevenue for a portion of its revenue for certain products.  American Institute\nof Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 98-9,\nModification of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, With Respect to Certain\nTransactions, requires companies to use the average sales price of each\nundelivered element of software arrangements to unbundle revenue.  Prior\nauthoritative accounting guidance allowed a comparison of the total price\ndifferential between a licensed product sold through different channels of\ndistribution to derive the value of undelivered elements offered to customers\nacquiring product from one channel but not the other.  Upon adoption of this new\nrule in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the percentages of the total\narrangement treated as unearned decreased.  This change reduced the amount of\nMicrosoft Windows and Microsoft Office sales treated as unearned and increased\nthe amount of revenue recognized upon shipment.  Additionally, as part of the\nCompany's long range planning process and a review of product shipment cycles,\nit was determined that the life cycle of Windows should be extended from two\nyears to three years.\n\n\nProduct Revenue\n\nMicrosoft has four segments:  Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services;\nConsumer Software, Services, and Devices; Consumer Commerce Investments; and\nOther.  The Management Discussion and Analysis presentation of revenue differs\nfrom that reported under the Company's Segment Information appearing in the\nNotes to Financial Statements because reconciling items are allocated to those\nsegments.\n\n                                      18\n##PAGE\n\nDesktop and Enterprise Software and Services\n\nDesktop and Enterprise Software and Services revenue was $17.84 billion, $20.40\nbillion, and $22.41 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Desktop and Enterprise\nSoftware and Services includes Desktop Applications; Desktop Platforms; and\nEnterprise Software and Services.\n\nDesktop Applications revenue was $7.77 billion, $9.30 billion, and $9.54 billion\nin 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Desktop Applications includes revenue from Microsoft\nOffice; Microsoft Project; Visio; client access licenses (CALs) for Windows NT\nServer and Windows 2000 Server, Exchange, and BackOffice; Microsoft Great\nPlains; and bCentral.  In fiscal 2001, revenue from client access licenses\nincreased 14% reflecting strong licensing growth of Windows NT Server and\nWindows 2000 Server CALs.  Office revenue growth was flat during the year.  In\nfiscal 2000 and 1999, revenue growth from Microsoft Office integrated suites,\nincluding the Premium, Professional, Small Business, and Standard Editions were\nvery solid.\n\nDesktop Platforms revenue was $6.74 billion, $7.02 billion, and $8.04 billion in\n1999, 2000, and 2001.  Desktop Platforms includes revenue from Windows 2000\nProfessional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Me, Windows 98, and other desktop\noperating systems.  Fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of\nWindows 2000 Professional, partially offset by flat revenue growth from Windows\nMe and Windows 98 operating systems, reflecting the slowdown in consumer PC\nshipments and a higher mix of Windows 2000 Professional and Windows NT\nWorkstation.  In fiscal 2000, Desktop Platforms revenue growth was modest due to\nsoft demand for business PCs during most of the year; a slowdown in shipments in\nanticipation of the post mid-year availability of Windows 2000 operating\nsystems; and, as expected, a longer business migration cycle for the newest\nWindows operating system offerings.  In fiscal 1999, Windows units licensed\nthrough the OEM channel, particularly Windows NT Workstation, increased strongly\nover the prior year.  Organizational licensing of Windows NT Workstation and\nWindows 98 also contributed to the growth.\n\nEnterprise Software and Services revenue was $3.33 billion, $4.08 billion, and\n$4.83 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Enterprise Software and Services\nincludes Enterprise Platforms, Server Applications, Developer Tools and\nServices, and Enterprise Services.  As a result of the continued adoption of\nMicrosoft's .NET Enterprise Server offerings in fiscal 2001, Server Applications\nrevenue increased 31% versus the prior year.  Enterprise Services revenue,\nrepresenting consulting and product support services, was up 34% compared to\nfiscal 2000.  Enterprise Platforms, which includes Windows 2000 Server and\nWindows NT Server operating systems, increased 10% while revenue from Developer\nTools and Services was flat with the prior year.  In fiscal 2000, Enterprise\nPlatforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by\ncustomers of Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server.  Revenue from Server\nApplications grew strongly, largely due to the strong success of SQL Server 7.0.\nSoftware Developer Tools and Services revenue declined, due to increased suite\nlicensing versus stand-alone licenses, and the lack of a release upgrade of the\nVisual Studio development system.  In fiscal 1999, the revenue growth rate for\nWindows NT Server was healthy.  Revenue from Server Applications grew strongly,\nreflecting, in part, the release of SQL Server 7.0.  The Visual Studio 6.0\ndevelopment system drove healthy Developer Tools and Services revenue growth.\nConsulting services revenue rose substantially.\n\nConsumer Software, Services, and Devices\n\nConsumer Software, Services, and Devices revenue was $1.19 billion, $1.63\nbillion, and $1.95 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Consumer Software,\nServices, and Devices includes MSN Internet access; MSN network service; WebTV\nInternet access and services; PC and online games; learning and productivity\nsoftware; mobile and wireless devices; and embedded systems.  In fiscal 2001,\nrevenue from MSN network services grew strongly in light of the decline in the\nonline advertising market.  MSN Internet access revenue also grew solidly as a\nresult of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the\naverage revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted\nunder rebate programs.  Revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the\nprior year, while learning and productivity software revenue and PC and online\ngames revenue declined, reflecting softness in the overall consumer market.  In\nfiscal 2000, online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher\nsubscriber totals, offset by lower net prices for Internet access subscriptions\ncompared to the prior year.  Additionally, strong sell-through of entertainment\nsoftware produced robust revenue growth.  In fiscal 1999, online advertising\nrevenue rose substantially and Internet access revenue increased moderately.\n\n                                      19\n##PAGE\n\nConsumer Commerce Investments\n\nConsumer Commerce Investments revenue was $62 million, $182 million, and $299\nmillion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Consumer Commerce Investments include Expedia,\nInc., the HomeAdvisor online real estate service, and the CarPoint online\nautomotive service.  Acquisitions of Travelscape.com and VacationSpot.com by\nExpedia, Inc., and increased product offerings from Expedia led to the strong\nrevenue growth in fiscal 2001.  The increased overall reach of all properties\nled to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000 and 1999.\n\nOn July 16, 2001, USA Networks, Inc. (USA) announced an agreement to acquire a\ncontrolling interest in Expedia through the purchase of up to 37.5 million\nshares, approximately 75% of the current outstanding shares.  If holders of more\nthan 37.5 million Expedia shares elect to sell their shares to USA, there will\nbe a pro rata reduction among all electing shareholders.  Microsoft has agreed\nto transfer all of its 33.7 million shares and warrants, subject to pro-ration.\nIt is expected that the transaction will close by December 31, 2001.\n\nOther\n\nOther revenue was $653 million, $754 million, and $630 million in 1999, 2000,\nand 2001.  Other primarily includes Hardware and Microsoft Press.  Lower sales\nof gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the\nconsumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001.  Continued success\nof the Company's new hardware device offerings led to the revenue growth in\nfiscal 2000.  Revenue from hardware devices and Microsoft Press was relatively\nflat in fiscal 1999.\n\nDistribution Channels\n\nMicrosoft distributes its products primarily through OEM licenses,\norganizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged\nproducts.  OEM channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment\nmanufacturers who preinstall Microsoft products, primarily on PCs.  Microsoft\nhas three major geographic sales and marketing regions: the South Pacific and\nAmericas Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Asia\nRegion.  Sales of organizational licenses and packaged products via these\nchannels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.\n\nOEM revenue was $6.40 billion in 1999, $7.01 billion in 2000, and $7.86 billion\nin 2001.  Although total licenses were impacted by a slowdown in PC shipments in\nfiscal 2001, the mix of the higher priced Windows 2000 Professional and Windows\nNT Workstation in the OEM channel increased substantially resulting in higher\naverage revenue per license.  The relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was\ndue to lower business PC shipment growth, especially as a result of the soft\ndemand for business PCs and component shortages for part of the year.  These\nissues combined with post mid-year availability of Windows 2000 Professional\nresulted in lower revenue growth.  Average earned revenue per license also\ndeclined compared to the prior year, due in part to a mix shift to the lower-\npriced Windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for\nbusiness PCs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain OEM\nchannel sectors.  In fiscal 1999, PC shipment growth coupled with an increased\npenetration of higher value 32-bit operating systems drove the OEM revenue\nincreases.\n\nSouth Pacific and Americas Region revenue was $7.25 billion, $8.33 billion, and\n$9.52 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  In fiscal 2001, revenue growth,\nprincipally in the United States, was led by strong licensing of Windows 2000\nProfessional and the family of .NET Enterprise Servers, particularly SQL Server\n2000 and Exchange 2000 Server.  Revenue from Enterprise services and MSN\nsubscription and services grew strongly.  In fiscal 2000, Office 2000 integrated\nsuites, Windows 2000 Server, online revenue, and SQL Server sales were the\nprimary drivers of the revenue growth.  Strong retail sales of hardware devices\nand consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year.\nRevenue growth was particularly strong in Latin America and Australia, moderate\nin Canada, and modest in the United States.  In fiscal 1999, server\napplications, Windows NT Server, Windows NT Workstation, and Microsoft Office\nall exhibited solid year-over-year growth rates.  Organizational licensing\nactivity was strong.  Revenue growth was solid in the United States and moderate\nin Latin America and the South Pacific.\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $4.33 billion, $5.02 billion,\nand $4.86 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  In fiscal 2001, weakening local\ncurrencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year.\nRevenue in the region would have increased 6% if foreign exchange rates were\nconstant with those of the prior year.  Revenue from Windows 2000 Professional\nand the .NET Enterprise Server family of products was very healthy.  In fiscal\n2000, retail sales of Windows operating systems and Office licensing produced\nmoderate growth in the region.  Growth from SQL Server licensing, new\n\n                                      20\n##PAGE\n\nhardware device offerings, and entertainment software was especially strong.\nRevenue growth, measured in constant dollars, was very healthy in Germany and\nItaly, robust in the Middle East, and low in the United Kingdom. In fiscal 1999,\nall major products grew strongly over the prior year. Revenue growth was solid\nin the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and was particularly high in Sweden,\nthe Netherlands, and Spain.\n\nAsia Region revenue was $1.78 billion in 1999, $2.60 billion in 2000, and $3.06\nbillion in 2001.  In fiscal 2001, the region's growth rate reflected strong\nrevenue from localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000 and Microsoft Office\nXP, especially the Office Personal suite.  The growth was also attributable to\nWindows 2000 Professional and .NET Server applications licensing.  Revenue\ngrowth was particularly strong in Korea and the greater China region, resulting\nfrom advantageous economic conditions as well as successful anti-piracy efforts.\nIn fiscal 2000, the region's growth rate reflected strong performance resulting\nfrom improved local economic conditions.  Revenue growth was also influenced by\nrobust growth of localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000, especially the\nOffice Personal Edition sold in Japan, Windows platform and server licensing,\nand strong adoption of SQL Server.  Revenue grew strongly in nearly all\ncountries in the Asia region.  In fiscal 1999, Japan, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong,\nand Southeast Asia had moderate revenue growth, while revenue grew very strongly\nin Korea.\n\nThe Company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.\nApproximately 29%, 30%, and 27% of the Company's revenue was collected in\nforeign currencies during 1999, 2000, and 2001.  Since a portion of local\ncurrency revenue is hedged and much of the Company's international manufacturing\ncosts and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies, the impact\nof exchange rates is partially mitigated.\n\n                                                              Operating Expenses\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCost of Revenue\n\nCost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 14.3% in 1999, 13.1% in 2000, and\n13.7% in 2001.  In fiscal 2001, higher support and service costs associated with\nthe MSN Internet access and MSN network services were partially offset by the\nlower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in\nthe mix of packaged product versus the prior year.  Cost of revenue in fiscal\n2000 reflected lower costs associated with WebTV Networks' operations, partially\noffset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs.  Cost of revenue as a\npercentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the trend in mix\nshift to OEM and organizational licenses.  Additionally, cost of revenue in 1999\nwas positively impacted by a reduction in estimates of obsolete inventory and\nother manufacturing costs of $67 million.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nMicrosoft continued to invest heavily in the future by funding research and\ndevelopment (R&D).  In fiscal 2001, the increase in R&D expense was the result\nof higher headcount-related costs and investments in new product initiatives.\nThe increase in fiscal 2000 was driven primarily by higher headcount-related\ncosts.  The increase in fiscal 1999 reflected higher development headcount-\nrelated costs offset by lower infrastructure and third-party development costs.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nIn fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue\nincreased due to higher relative headcount-related costs, higher marketing and\nsales expenses associated with MSN, the Microsoft Agility advertising campaign,\nand other new sales initiatives.  In fiscal 2000, sales and marketing expenses\nas a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs\nassociated with new product releases and online marketing.  In fiscal 1999,\nsales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower\nrelative sales expenses and lower relative marketing costs.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nIn fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a charge\nrelated to the settlement of the lawsuit with Caldera, Inc. recorded in fiscal\n2000.  Excluding this charge, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001\nincreased from the prior year due to higher headcount-related costs and legal\nfees.  For fiscal 2000, besides the settlement of the lawsuit, general and\nadministrative expenses also reflected increased legal fees and certain employee\nstock option-related expenses.  The increase in fiscal year 1999 was\nattributable to higher legal fees, settlement costs, and headcount-related costs\nnecessary to support the Company's expanding operations.\n\n                                      21\n##PAGE\n\n                 Non-operating Items, Investment Income/(Loss), and Income Taxes\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLosses on equity investees and other incorporates Microsoft's share of income or\nloss from the MSNBC entities, Avanade, Wireless Knowledge, StarBand\nCommunications, and other investments accounted for using the equity method.\nThe increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an\nincrease in the number of such investments during the year.  In fiscal 2000 and\n1999, losses on equity investees decreased reflecting smaller losses from the\nMSNBC entities.\n\nIn fiscal 2001, the Company reported an investment loss of $36 million, a\ndecrease in investment income of $3.36 billion versus fiscal 2000.  Net\nrecognized losses were $2.22 billion in fiscal 2001, reflecting $4.80 billion in\nimpairments of certain investments, primarily in the cable and telecommunication\nindustries, and $592 million of net losses attributable to derivative\ninstruments.  These losses were partially offset by higher net gains from the\nsales of investments, including a gain from Microsoft's investment in Titus\nCommunications (which was merged with Jupiter Telecommunications) and the\nclosing of the sale of Transpoint to CheckFree Holdings Corp.  Interest and\ndividend income increased $591 million from the prior year, reflecting a larger\ninvestment portfolio.  In fiscal years 2000 and 1999, investment income\nincreased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by\ncash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities.\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 was 33%.  The effective tax rate for\nfiscal 2000 was 34%.  Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of Softimage,\nInc., the effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 35%.\n\n                                                               Accounting Change\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEffective July 1, 2000, Microsoft adopted Statement of Financial Accounting\nStandards (SFAS) 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nActivities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative\ninstruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other\ncontracts and for hedging activities.  All derivatives, whether designated in\nhedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet\nat fair value.  If the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the\nchanges in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized\nin earnings.  If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in\nthe fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income\n(OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects\nearnings.\n\n\nThe adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of\n$560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to OCI\nof $112 million ($75 million after-tax).  The reduction to income was mostly\nattributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from OCI for\nthe time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified\nfrom OCI for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.  The reduction\nto OCI was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash\nflow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of OCI of the approximately $300\nmillion loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million\nloss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nFinancial Condition\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $31.60 billion at\nJune 30, 2001.  The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities,\ndiversified among industries and individual issuers.  Microsoft's investments\nare generally liquid and investment grade.  The portfolio is invested\npredominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign\ncurrency positions in order to diversify financial risk.  The portfolio is\nprimarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and\nfacilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.\n\nCash flow from operations was $13.42 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of\n$2.00 billion from the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to\nthe growth in revenue and other changes in working capital, partially offset by\nthe decrease in the stock option income tax benefit, reflecting decreased stock\noption exercises by employees.  Cash used for financing was $5.59 billion in\nfiscal 2001, an increase of $3.39 billion from the prior year.  The increase\nprimarily reflects the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001, compared to\nthe sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in\ncommon stock repurchased.  All outstanding put warrants were either retired or\nexercised during fiscal 2001.  During fiscal\n\n                                      22\n##PAGE\n\n2001, the Company repurchased 89.0 million shares. Cash used for investing was\n$8.73 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $658 million from the prior year.\n\nIn fiscal 2000, cash flow from operations was $11.43 billion, a decrease of $720\nmillion from the prior year, reflecting working capital changes partially offset\nby the increase in the stock option income tax benefit.  Cash used for financing\nwas $2.19 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of $1.33 billion from the prior\nyear, reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year.\nDuring fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 55.2 million shares.  Cash used for\ninvesting was $9.39 billion in fiscal 2000, a decrease of $808 million from the\nprior year.  In fiscal 1999, cash flow from operations was $12.15 billion, an\nincrease of $3.78 billion from the prior year, reflecting the growth in revenue\nand the increase in the stock option income tax benefit.  Cash used for\nfinancing was $862 million in fiscal 1999, a decrease of $137 million from the\nprior year.  During fiscal 1999, the Company repurchased 44.9 million shares.\nCash used for investing was $10.20 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of $3.00\nbillion from the prior year, reflecting the growth in the investment portfolio.\n\nMicrosoft has no material long-term debt.  Stockholders' equity at June 30, 2001\nwas $47.29 billion.  Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and\nproduct support infrastructure.  Additionally, research and development\nactivities will include investments in existing and advanced areas of\ntechnology, including using cash to acquire technology.  Additions to property\nand equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for\nR&D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.  Commitments for\nconstructing new buildings were $181 million on June 30, 2001.  Cash will also\nbe used for strategic opportunities.\n\nIn addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for\nemployee stock option and purchase plans.  Since fiscal 1990, Microsoft has\nrepurchased 854 million common shares while 2.12 billion shares were issued\nunder the Company's employee stock option and purchase plans.  The market value\nof all outstanding stock options was $66 billion as of June 30, 2001.  During\nDecember 1996, Microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible\nexchangeable preferred stock.  The Company's convertible preferred stock matured\non December 15, 1999.  Each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common\nshares.\n\nManagement believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds\ngenerated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements.\nThe Company's cash and short-term investments are available for strategic\ninvestments, mergers and acquisitions, and other potential large-scale needs and\nto fund the share repurchase program.  Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on\nits common stock.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 141, Business\nCombinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.  SFAS 141\nrequires business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for\nusing the purchase method of accounting.  It also specifies the types of\nacquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported\nseparately from goodwill.  SFAS 142 will require that goodwill and certain\nintangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least\nannually.  SFAS 142 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2001, with early application permitted in certain\ncircumstances.  The Company plans to early adopt SFAS 142 in fiscal 2002 and\ndoes not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption.  Goodwill amortization\nwas approximately $300 million in fiscal 2001 and approximately $225 million in\nfiscal 2000.\n\nIssues and Uncertainties\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhile Microsoft management is optimistic about the Company's long-term\nprospects, the following issues and uncertainties, among others, should be\nconsidered in evaluating its growth outlook.\n\nRapid Technological Change and Competition\nRapid change, uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies, and fierce\ncompetition characterize the software industry, which means that Microsoft's\nmarket position is always at risk.  Microsoft's ability to maintain its current\nmarket share may depend upon the Company's ability to satisfy customer\nrequirements, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products and\nachieve market acceptance of such products.  This process grows more challenging\nas the pace of change continues to accelerate.  Open source\n\n                                      23\n##PAGE\n\nsoftware, new computing devices, new microprocessor architectures, the Internet,\nand Web-based computing models are among the competitive challenges the Company\nmust meet. If Microsoft does not successfully identify new product opportunities\nand develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-efficient\nmanner, the Company's business growth will suffer and demand for its products\nwill decrease.\n\nFuture Initiatives\n\nThe Company plans to continue to make significant investments in software\nresearch and development including Microsoft .NET, \"HailStorm\", Xbox, wireless\ntechnologies, digital devices, television, and small business.  It is\nanticipated that these investments in research and development will increase\nover historical spending levels.  Significant revenue from these product\nopportunities may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all.\n\nPC Growth Rates\n\nThe nature of the PC marketplace is changing in ways that may reduce Microsoft's\nsoftware sales and revenue growth.  Overall market demand for PCs can\nsignificantly impact Microsoft's revenue growth.  Recently, manufacturers have\nsought to reach more consumers by developing and producing lower cost PCs - PCs\nthat come without pre-installed software or contain software with reduced\nfunctionality.  In addition to the influx of low-cost PCs, a market for handheld\ncomputing and communication devices has developed.  While these devices are not\nas powerful or versatile as PCs, they threaten to erode sales growth in the\nmarket for PCs with pre-installed software.  This may affect Microsoft's revenue\ngrowth because manufacturers may choose not to install Microsoft software in\nthese low-cost PCs or consumers may purchase alternative intelligent devices\nthat do not use Microsoft software.  These lower-priced devices require\nMicrosoft to provide lower-priced software with a subset of the original\nfunctionality.  As a result, the Company may generate less revenue from the sale\nof software produced for these devices than from the sale of software for PCs.\n\nProduct Development\n\nThe software industry is inherently complex.  New products and product\nenhancements can require long development and testing periods.  Significant\ndelays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products\ncould damage Microsoft's business.  The Company anticipates that Windows XP and\nXbox will be released in fiscal 2002.  Delays in either product may adversely\naffect revenue and net income.\n\nPrices\n\nThe competitive factors described above may require Microsoft to lower product\nprices to meet competition, reducing the Company's revenue and net income.\n\nEarnings Process\n\nAn increasingly higher percentage of the Company's revenue is subject to ratable\nrecognition, which impacts the timing of revenue and earnings recognition.\nRatable revenue recognition may be required for additional products, depending\non specific license terms and conditions.  Also, maintenance and new\nsubscription programs are increasing in popularity.\n\nEmployee Compensation\n\nMicrosoft employees currently receive salaries, incentive bonuses, other\nbenefits, and stock options.  New government regulations, poor stock price\nperformance, or other factors could diminish the value of the option program to\ncurrent and prospective employees and require the Company to pay higher salaries\nand other cash compensation.\n\nInternational Operations\n\nMicrosoft develops and sells products throughout the world.  The prices of the\nCompany's products in countries outside of the United States are generally\nhigher than the Company's prices in the United States because of the cost\nincurred in localizing software for non-U.S. markets.  The costs of producing\nand selling the Company's products in these countries are also higher.  Pressure\nto globalize Microsoft's pricing structure might require that the Company reduce\nthe sales price of its software in other countries, even though the costs of the\nsoftware continue to be higher than in the United States.  Unfavorable changes\nin software \"piracy\" trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other\nregulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in\nregulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic\nconditions in a specific country or region; difficulties in staffing and\nmanaging foreign\n\n                                      24\n##PAGE\n\noperations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences; among other factors,\ncould also have an impact on the Company's business and results of operations\noutside of the United States.\n\nIntellectual Property Rights\n\nMicrosoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights, but unlicensed\ncopying of software represents a loss of revenue to the Company.  While this\nadversely affects U.S. revenue, revenue loss is even more significant outside of\nthe United States, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of\nintellectual property rights.  Throughout the world, Microsoft actively educates\nconsumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers\non the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are\nprotected.  However, continued efforts may not affect revenue positively.\n\nLitigation\n\nLitigation regarding intellectual property rights, patents, and copyrights\noccurs in the software industry.  In addition, there are government regulation\nand investigation risks along with other general corporate legal risks.  The\nCompany is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the Antitrust Division of the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice and a group of eighteen state Attorneys General alleging\nviolations of the Sherman Act and various state antitrust laws.  After the\ntrial, the District Court entered Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\nstating that Microsoft had violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and\nvarious state antitrust laws.  A Judgment was entered on June 7, 2000 ordering,\namong other things, the breakup of Microsoft into two companies.  The Judgment\nwas stayed pending an appeal.  On June 28, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for\nthe District of Columbia Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated\nthe Judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court for a\nnew trial on one Section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with\nits ruling.  In its ruling, the Court of Appeals substantially narrowed the\nbases of liability found by the District Court, but affirmed some of the\nDistrict Court's conclusions that Microsoft had violated Section 2.  On\nSeptember 6, 2001, the plaintiffs announced that on remand they will not ask the\nCourt to break Microsoft up, that they will seek imposition of conduct remedies,\nand that they will not retry the one Section 1 claim returned to the District\nCourt by the Court of Appeals.  On August 7, 2001, Microsoft petitioned the\nSupreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the appellate court's ruling\nconcerning its disqualification of the District Court judge.  Microsoft may\npetition the Supreme Court to review other aspects of the appellate court's\ndecision after final judgment is entered.  In response to the Court of Appeal's\ndecision, Microsoft has modified the terms of its agreements with computer\nmanufacturers to permit them to remove Internet Explorer icons from Windows when\nthe manufacturer wants to promote an alternative browser, and modifying other\nprovisions of the agreements.  While the Company cannot predict with certainty\nthe final outcome of this matter, its resolution may result in additional\nchanges to the Company's business practices and could affect how the Company\ndevelops and markets new products and services.  In addition, while the Court of\nAppeals ruling vacated the remedies portion of the Judgment in its entirety, it\nis possible the District Court could enter a new judgment providing for certain\nremedies that would have a material adverse effect on the Company if the Company\ncannot obtain relief from such provisions on appeal.\n\nA large number of antitrust class action lawsuits have been initiated against\nMicrosoft. These cases allege that Microsoft has competed unfairly and\nunlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain\nsoftware applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the\ncomplaints contend Microsoft charged for these products. Although Microsoft\nbelieves the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases, the\nCompany cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.\n\nFuture Growth Rate\n\nThe revenue growth rate in 2002 may not approach the level attained in prior\nyears. Because of the fixed nature of a significant portion of operating\nexpenses, coupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth, operating\nmargins in 2002 may decrease from those in 2001. In addition, with the\nanticipated introduction of Xbox in fiscal 2002, cost of revenue as a percentage\nof revenue may increase versus prior years.\n"}, "2002": {"item1": " ITEM 1.

Microsoft Press books are authored by professional and technical writers, both by Microsoft employees and independent authors. \n\n&#160; \n\nSEGMENT REPORTING \n\n&#160; \n\nIn fiscal 2003, the Company will begin reporting the following operating segments: Client; Information Worker; MSN; Home and Entertainment; CE Mobility; Server and Tools; and Business Solutions. These changes are designed to provide a comprehensive end-to-end financial view of Microsoft&#146;s key businesses; promote better alignment of strategies and objectives between development, sales, marketing, and services organizations; provide for more timely and rational allocation of development, sales, and marketing resources within businesses; and focus strategic planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives and give business owners more autonomy in detailed planning. \n\n&#160; \n\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has entered into joint venture arrangements to take advantage of creative talent and content from other organizations. For example, Microsoft owns 50 percent of MSNBC Cable L.L.C., a 24-hour cable news and information channel, and 50 percent of MSNBC Interactive News L.L.C., an interactive online news service. National Broadcasting Company (NBC) owns the remaining 50 percent of these two joint ventures. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n4 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002, research and development expense was $3.77 billion, $4.38 billion, and $4.31 billion, respectively. Those amounts represented 16.4%, 17.3%, and 15.2%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the amortization of goodwill was discontinued in fiscal 2002. The amount of goodwill amortization included in research and development expense in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 was $232 million and $272 million, respectively. The Company plans to continue significant expenditures for research and product development. \n\nMost of the Company&#146;s software products are developed internally. The Company also purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees third-party development and localization of certain products. Internal development allows Microsoft to maintain closer technical control over its products and gives the Company the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. Microsoft works on devising innovative solutions to computer science problems, such as making computers easier to use, designing software for the next generation of hardware, improving the software design process, and investigating the mathematical underpinnings of computer science. The Company has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products. These tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product&#146;s portability among different operating systems, microprocessors, or computing devices. Product documentation is generally created internally. The Company strives to become informed at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, Microsoft provides to software vendors a range of development, training, testing resources, and guidelines for developing applications. \n\nThe software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which requires constant attention to computing technology trends, shifting consumer demand, and rapid product innovation. The pace of change is accelerating as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the PC toward intelligent devices and appliances, such as the Tablet PC. Tablet PCs extend the power of laptop computers running Windows XP with enhanced capabilities such as handwriting and speech input. \n\nThe Company believes that making its products trustworthy is critical to their success and has launched a company-wide effort called Trustworthy Computing. Trustworthy Computing has four pillars: reliability, security, privacy, and business integrity. Reliability means that a computer system is dependable, is available when needed, and performs as expected and at appropriate levels. Security means that a system is resilient to attack, and that the confidentiality, integrity and availability of both the system and its data are protected. Privacy means that individuals have the ability to control data about themselves and that those using such data faithfully adhere to fair information principles. Business integrity, in this context, is about being responsible to customers and helping them find appropriate solutions for their business issues, addressing problems with products or services, and being open in interactions with customers. While the Company is continuing to invest significantly in delivering new capabilities that customers ask for, Microsoft is making security improvements a high priority. \n\nMicrosoft .NET is Microsoft&#146;s platform for XML Web services. XML Web services allow applications to communicate and share data over the Internet or an intranet, regardless of operating system or programming language. The Microsoft .NET platform includes a comprehensive family of products, built on XML and other Internet industry standards, which provide for each aspect of developing, managing, using, and experiencing XML Web services. There are five areas where Microsoft is building the .NET platform today: Tools, Servers, XML Web Services, Clients, and .NET Experiences. In the Tools area, Visual Studio .NET and the Microsoft .NET framework supply a complete solution for developers to build, deploy, and run XML Web services. They maximize the performance, reliability, and security of XML Web services. The .NET Enterprise Servers, including the Windows 2000 Server family, make up Microsoft .NET&#146;s server infrastructure for deploying, managing, and orchestrating XML Web services. Designed with mission-critical performance in mind, they provide enterprises with the agility they need to integrate their systems, applications, and partners through XML Web services, and the flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements. Clients are PCs, laptops, workstations, phones, handheld computers, Tablet PCs, game consoles, and other smart devices. These smart devices use software that supports XML Web services, which enable users to access their data regardless of the location, type, and number of clients used. Smart clients and devices leverage XML Web services to create .NET experiences that allow users to access information across the Internet and from stand-alone applications in an integrated way. \n\nTo best serve the needs of users around the world, Microsoft &#147;localizes&#148; many of its products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the quality and usability of the product in international markets. Localizing a product might require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. In Japanese versions, for example, all user messages and documentation are in Japanese with monetary references in the Japanese yen. Various Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages. \n\n&#160; \n\nMANUFACTURING \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft contracts out most of its manufacturing activities to third parties. Outside manufacturers produce the Xbox, various retail software packaged products, and hardware. There are other custom manufacturers Microsoft could use in the event outsourced manufacturing becomes unavailable from current vendors. The Company generally has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components and is often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. The graphics processing unit (GPU) for the Xbox was custom designed and is produced by NVIDIA Corporation. Quality control tests are performed on purchased parts, CD-ROMs, and other products. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n5 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company has regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and the Greater Seattle area. The regional centers support all operations, including information processing, vendor management and logistics by geographical regions. The regional center in Dublin, Ireland supports the European, African, and Middle East regions, the center in Singapore supports the Asia Pacific region, and the center in the Greater Seattle area supports North and South America. Microsoft Licensing, Inc. (MSLI), a wholly-owned subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, manages the Company&#146;s original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and certain organizational licensing operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES AND MARKETING \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft distributes its products primarily through the following channels: OEM; volume licensing; online services and products; and distributors and retailers. In fiscal 2002, Microsoft had three major geographic sales and marketing regions: the South Pacific and Americas Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Asia Region. Beginning with fiscal 2003, the Company&#146;s geographic sales and marketing organization was modified to remove the South Pacific region from the Americas organization, and combine it with Asia. Sales of volume licenses and packaged software products via these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers. \n\n&#160; \n\nOEM. Microsoft operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of the Company&#146;s products with their computing devices, principally PCs. The Company also markets and licenses certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software programs to OEMs under similar arrangements. In almost all cases, the products are distributed under Microsoft trademarks. The Company has OEM agreements covering one or more of its products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including Acer, Actebis, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Gateway, HP, IBM, NEC, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors. \n\n&#160; \n\nVolume Licensing. The Microsoft Enterprise Agreement program is a licensing program designed to provide a flexible licensing and service solution tailored to customers making a long-term licensing commitment. The agreements are designed to simplify license administration, payment terms, and the contract process. The Microsoft Select program offers flexible software acquisition, licensing, and maintenance options specially customized to meet the needs of large multinational organizations. Marketing efforts and fulfillment are generally coordinated with large account resellers. The Microsoft Open program is a licensing program that is targeted for small- and medium-sized organizations. It is available through the reseller channel and offers discounts based on initial purchase volumes. The Microsoft Enterprise Agreement and Software Assurance under the Select and Open programs provide customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage. \n\n&#160; \n\nNetwork Service Providers. Microsoft Network Service Providers (NSP) work with a variety of companies worldwide to help them develop and deploy end-to-end network solutions based on Microsoft platforms. NSPs focus on key network service industries including telecommunications and wireless companies and hosts. \n\n&#160; \n\nOnline Services and Products. Microsoft distributes online content and services through MSN Access, MSN Network Services, bCentral small business portal, and other online services. MSN Access delivers simple, personalized Internet access, useful content, services and tools using MSN Internet Explorer. MSN Network Services delivers advertising and other services including online search, shopping, and messaging capabilities to Internet users. bCentral provides the tools and expertise for small-business owners to build, market and manage their businesses online. Other services delivered online include MSDN subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support Microsoft partners in developing and selling Microsoft products and solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nDistributors and Resellers. The Company distributes products in the finished goods channels primarily to independent non-exclusive distributors and resellers. Distributors and resellers include Ingram Micro, Tech Data, Level 3 Communications, SOFTBANK, Software House International, ASAP Software Express, and Happinet Corporation. Microsoft has a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel who solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. \n\n&#160; \n\nCUSTOMERS \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, educational institutions, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and organizations obtain Microsoft products primarily through resellers and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with their computing devices. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2000, 2001, or 2002. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n6 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCOMPETITION \n\n&#160; \n\nThe software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. As the company pursues its largest strategic initiative, Microsoft .NET, the Company could experience more intense competition during the transition from the traditional core businesses to its new products based on the .NET architecture. The Company continues to face movement from PC-based applications to server-based applications or Web-based application hosting services, from proprietary software to open source software such as the Linux operating system, and from PCs to Internet-based devices. A number of Microsoft&#146;s most significant competitors, including IBM, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and AOL-Time Warner, are collaborating with one another on various initiatives directed at competing with Microsoft. These initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual PCs to centrally managed servers, which would present significant challenges to the Company&#146;s historical business model. Other competitive collaborative efforts include the development of new platform technologies that are intended to replicate much of the value of Microsoft Windows operating systems. New computing form factors, including non-PC information devices, are gaining popularity and competing with PCs running Microsoft&#146;s software products. \n\nMicrosoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas of its current business activities. The rapid pace of technological change, particularly in the area of Internet platforms and services, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. Global software piracy&#151;the unlawful copying and distribution of Microsoft&#146;s copyrighted software products&#151;deprives the Company of large amounts of revenue on an annual basis. \n\nThe Company&#146;s competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section, particularly in view of the fast pace of technological change in the computing industry. \n\n&#160; \n\nDESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s competitors include many software application vendors, such as IBM, Oracle, Apple, Sun Microsystems, Corel, Qualcomm, and local application developers in Europe and Asia. IBM and Corel have large installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, IBM and Apple preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with Microsoft&#146;s desktop application software. Sun Microsystems&#146; Star Office is aggressively priced. Additionally, Web-based application hosting services provide an alternative to PC-based applications such as Microsoft Office. \n\nMicrosoft&#146;s PC and server operating system products face substantial competition from a wide variety of companies. Competitors such as IBM, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems, and others are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. Many of these operating system software products are also licensed to third-party OEMs for preinstallation on their computers. Microsoft&#146;s operating system products compete with UNIX-based operating systems from a wide range of companies, including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems. The Linux open source operating system has gained increasing acceptance as well. Several computer manufacturers preinstall Linux on PC servers and many leading software developers have written applications that run on Linux. Microsoft Windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms such as those based on Internet browsing software and Java technology promoted by AOL-Time Warner and Sun Microsystems. \n\nThe Company competes in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several competitors who enjoy a larger share of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer operating system software for mainframes and midrange computers, including IBM, HP, and Sun Microsystems. Since legacy business systems are typically support-intensive, these competitors also offer substantial support services. Software developers that provide competing server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer Associates, Sybase, and Informix. There are also several software vendors who offer connectivity servers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies and organizations that offer Internet and intranet server software, which compete against the Company&#146;s business systems. Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with the Company&#146;s collaboration and e-mail products. \n\nThe Company&#146;s developer products compete against offerings from BEA Systems, Borland, IBM, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, and other companies. \n\n&#160; \n\nCONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft&#146;s online services network, MSN, faces formidable competition from AOL-Time Warner, Yahoo!, and a vast array of Web sites and portals that offer content of all types and e-mail, instant messaging, calendaring, chat, and search and shopping services, among other things. \n\nXbox competes head-to-head against game systems from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large established base of game system users. Game developers like Activision, Capcom, Electronic Arts, Sega, Tecmo, and THQ, to name a few, are both partners and competitors. \n\nMicrosoft faces many competitors in the mobile devices space, including Palm, Symbian, Nokia, and Openwave. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. Key competitors include Wind River and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Red Hat, Lineo, and MontaVista. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n7 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart I \n\nItem 1, 2, 3, 4 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft faces many competitors in the online real estate and online automotive service spaces, including Homestore, AOL&#146;s House and Home channel, Autobytel, AOL autos, and Yahoo! autos. \n\n&#160; \n\nOTHER \n\n&#160; \n\nPC input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers, since computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other manufacturers of these devices. Microsoft Press competes in the retail book and eLearning markets with publishers that also create content on Microsoft technologies. A few of the retail competitors are Pearson, WROX, Sybex, and Wiley. The major eLearning competitors are Smartforce and NetG. \n\n&#160; \n\nEMPLOYEES \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of June 30, 2002, the Company employed approximately 50,500 people on a full-time basis, 34,600 in the United States and 15,900 internationally. Of the total, 20,800 were in product research and development, 23,500 in sales, marketing, and support, 2,200 in manufacturing and distribution, and 4,000 in finance and administration. Microsoft&#146;s success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software industry. To date, the Company believes it has been successful in its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to be as successful in the future. None of the Company&#146;s employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes relations with its employees are excellent. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS \n\nOF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2000, 2001, AND 2002 \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in &#147;Issues and Uncertainties.&#148; \n\n&#160; \n\nREVENUE \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s revenue growth rate was 16% in fiscal 2000, 10% in fiscal 2001, and 12% in fiscal 2002. Revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of Xbox video game system revenue and the strong penetration of Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Home operating systems. Revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by licensing of Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional, Microsoft SQL Server, and the other .NET Enterprise Servers. Revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was driven by strong licensing of Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server, Microsoft Office 2000, and SQL Server. \n\nMicrosoft continued to see a mix shift to volume licensing programs. On October 1, 2001, Microsoft launched Licensing 6.0 to simplify and improve its volume licensing programs, including a simplified approach to software upgrades. One feature of Licensing 6.0 is Software Assurance which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage. The success of Microsoft&#146;s new volume licensing programs will continue to affect the mix of multi-year licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, the timing and extent of a recovery in consumer and corporate spending on PCs and information technology (IT) will be factors affecting revenue growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT REVENUE \n\n&#160; \n\nIn fiscal 2002, Microsoft had four segments: Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services; Consumer Software, Services, and Devices; Consumer Commerce Investments; and Other. The revenue figures in this Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) differ from those reported in the Company&#146;s Segment Information appearing in Note 20 of the Notes to Financial Statements. The revenue figures in the Segment Information represent amounts reported internally for management reporting, while the revenue figures in the MD&#38;A reflect revenue recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. On July 1, 2002, Microsoft revised its product segments and will begin reporting the new segments in fiscal 2003. \n\n&#160; \n\nDesktop and Enterprise Software and Services . Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services revenue was $20.40 billion, $22.41 billion, and $24.01 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services includes Desktop Applications; Desktop Platforms; and Enterprise Software and Services. \n\nDesktop Applications revenue was $9.30 billion, $9.54 billion, and $9.60 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Desktop Applications includes revenue from Microsoft Office; Microsoft Project; Visio; client access licenses (CALs) for Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server, Exchange, and BackOffice; Microsoft Great Plains; and bCentral. In fiscal 2002, Office licensing revenue declined during the year due to a strong mix shift to multi-year annuity licensing agreements, which deferred revenue recognition to future years, and a decrease in consumer purchases in the Asia region, most notably Japan, partially offset by strong OEM licensing. Revenue from client access licenses grew 3% in fiscal 2002 and revenue from Great Plains contributed to the growth in Desktop Applications. In fiscal 2001, revenue from client access licenses increased 14% reflecting strong licensing growth of Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server CALs. Office revenue growth was flat during fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, revenue growth from Microsoft Office integrated suites, including the Premium, Professional, Small Business, and Standard Editions was very solid. \n\nDesktop Platforms revenue was $7.02 billion, $8.04 billion, and $9.30 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Desktop Platforms includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Workstation, Windows Me, Windows 98, and other desktop operating systems. In fiscal 2002, the growth in Desktop Platforms revenue reflected strong multi-year licensing revenue growth and a continued mix shift to the higher priced Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional operating system through OEMs, despite a decline in reported OEM unit shipments. Fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of Windows 2000 Professional, partially offset by flat revenue growth from Windows Me and Windows 98 operating systems, reflecting the slowdown in consumer PC shipments and a higher mix of Windows 2000 Professional and Windows NT Workstation. In fiscal 2000, Desktop Platforms revenue growth was modest due to soft demand for business PCs during most of the year; a slowdown in shipments in anticipation of the post mid-year availability of Windows 2000 operating systems; and, as expected, a longer business migration cycle for the newest Windows operating system offerings. The rate of growth in PC shipments and the mix of Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional as a percentage of all 32-bit operating systems will continue to impact revenue growth in the future. \n\nEnterprise Software and Services revenue was $4.08 billion, $4.83 billion, and $5.11 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Enterprise Software and Services includes Server Platforms, Server Applications, Developer Tools and Services, and Enterprise Services. In fiscal 2002, Server Applications, including Microsoft SQL Server and .NET Enterprise Servers, increased 10% compared to fiscal 2001. Server Platform revenue, which includes Windows 2000 Server and Windows NT Server operating systems, increased 10% versus fiscal 2001 driven by a modest overall increase in Windows-based server shipments and increased deployment of Windows 2000 Server. Enterprise Services revenue, representing consulting and product support services, was up 17% compared to fiscal 2001, while revenue from Developer Tools and Services was down 19% from fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, Server Applications revenue increased 31% versus the prior year as a result of \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n12 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nthe continued adoption of Microsoft&#146;s .NET Enterprise Server offerings. Enterprise Services revenue in fiscal 2001, was up 34% compared to fiscal 2000 and Server Platforms increased 10% while revenue from Developer Tools and Services was flat. In fiscal 2000, Server Platforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by customers of Windows NT Server and Windows 2000 Server. Revenue from Server Applications grew strongly in fiscal 2000, largely due to the strong success of SQL Server 7.0, while Software Developer Tools and Services revenue declined, due to increased suite licensing versus stand-alone licenses, and the lack of a release upgrade of the Visual Studio development system. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer Software, Services, and Devices. Consumer Software, Services, and Devices revenue was $1.63 billion, $1.95 billion, and $3.59 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Consumer Software, Services, and Devices includes the Xbox video game system; MSN Internet access; MSN network service; PC and online games; learning and productivity software; mobility; and embedded systems. The majority of the revenue growth from fiscal 2001 stemmed from sales of the Xbox video game system released in fiscal 2002. MSN Internet access revenue increased as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. Revenue from MSN network services increased despite a declining Internet advertising market. Revenue from embedded systems in fiscal 2002 grew nicely, however learning and productivity software revenue and PC and online games declined compared to fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, revenue from MSN network services grew strongly despite a decline in the online advertising market. MSN Internet access revenue also grew solidly from fiscal 2000 as a result of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs. Revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the prior year, while learning and productivity software revenue and PC and online games revenue declined, reflecting softness in the overall consumer market. In fiscal 2000, online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher subscriber totals, offset by lower net prices for Internet access subscriptions compared to the prior year. Additionally, strong sales of entertainment software in fiscal 2000 produced robust revenue growth in PC and online games. \n\n&#160; \n\nConsumer Commerce Investments. Consumer Commerce Investments revenue was $182 million, $299 million, and $242 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Consumer Commerce Investments include Expedia, Inc., the HomeAdvisor online real estate service, and the CarPoint online automotive service. The decline in revenue compared to fiscal 2001 reflects the sale of Microsoft&#146;s majority ownership of Expedia, Inc. to USA Networks, Inc. on February 4, 2002. Acquisitions of Travelscape.com and VacationSpot.com by Expedia, Inc., and increased product offerings from Expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2001. The increased overall reach of all properties led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther. Other revenue, which primarily includes Hardware and Microsoft Press, was $754 million, $630 million, and $530 million in 2000, 2001, and 2002. In fiscal 2002, continued declines in the IT book and consumer market led to a decline in Microsoft Press and Hardware sales. Lower sales of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001. Continued success of the Company&#146;s new hardware device offerings led to revenue growth in fiscal 2000. \n\n&#160; \n\nDISTRIBUTION CHANNELS \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft distributes its products primarily through the following channels: OEM; volume licensing; online services and products; and distributors and retailers. OEM channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment manufacturers who preinstall Microsoft products, primarily on PCs. Microsoft has three major geographic sales and marketing regions: the South Pacific and Americas Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Asia Region. Sales of volume licenses and packaged software products via these channels are primarily to distributors and resellers. \n\nOEM revenue was $7.01 billion in 2000, $7.86 billion in 2001, and $9.00 billion in 2002. In fiscal 2002, reported licenses declined compared to fiscal 2001. However, a strong increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional licenses, and healthy growth in direct and system builder OEMs licenses, led to higher average revenue per license and contributed to the overall OEM revenue growth over fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, while total licenses were also impacted by a slowdown in PC shipments, the mix of the higher priced Windows 2000 Professional and Windows NT Workstation increased substantially resulting in higher average revenue per license. A relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was due to lower business PC shipment growth combined with post mid-year availability of Windows 2000 Professional. Average earned revenue per license also declined in fiscal 2000 compared to the prior year, due in part to a mix shift to the lower-priced Windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for business PCs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain OEM channel sectors. \n\nSouth Pacific and Americas Region revenue was $8.33 billion, $9.52 billion, and $11.41 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. In fiscal 2002, the majority of the revenue growth was driven by sales of the Xbox video game system released during the year, as well as strong Windows XP Professional licensing, MSN subscription revenue, and revenue from Microsoft Great Plains. In fiscal 2001, revenue growth was led by strong licensing of Windows 2000 Professional and the family of .NET Enterprise Servers, particularly SQL Server 2000 and Exchange 2000 Server. Revenue from Enterprise services and MSN subscription and services also grew strongly in fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2000, Office 2000 integrated suites, Windows 2000 Server, online revenue, and SQL Server sales were the primary drivers of the revenue growth. Strong retail sales of hardware devices and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year. \n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa Region revenue was $5.02 billion, $4.86 billion, and $5.13 billion in 2000, 2001, and 2002. In fiscal 2002, the majority of the growth was a result of strong multi-year licensing revenue of Windows XP Home and Professional operating systems and Enterprise Software, as well as the addition of Xbox video game system revenue in the second half of the year. In fiscal 2001, weakening local currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year, while revenue from Windows 2000 Professional and the .NET Enterprise Server family of products was very healthy. In fiscal 2000, retail sales of Windows operating systems and \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n13 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nOffice licensing produced moderate growth in the region. Growth from SQL Server licensing, new hardware device offerings, and entertainment software was especially strong. \n\nAsia Region revenue was $2.60 billion in 2000, $3.06 billion in 2001, and $2.83 billion in 2002. In fiscal 2002, Asia region revenue declined most notably due to lower consumer PC shipments, which hampered revenue from localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000 and Microsoft Office XP, especially the Office Personal Edition. Xbox video game system sales partially offset the decline in Office revenue. In fiscal 2001, the region&#146;s growth rate reflected strong revenue from localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000 and Microsoft Office XP, especially the Office Personal Edition. This growth was also attributable to Windows 2000 Professional and .NET Server applications licensing. In fiscal 2000, the region&#146;s growth rate reflected strong performance resulting from improved local economic conditions. Revenue growth was also influenced by robust growth of localized versions of Microsoft Office 2000, especially the Office Personal Edition sold in Japan, Windows platform and server licensing, and strong adoption of SQL Server. \n\nThe Company&#146;s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. Approximately 30%, 27%, and 25% of the Company&#146;s revenue was collected in foreign currencies during 2000, 2001, and 2002. Since a portion of local currency revenue is hedged and much of the Company&#146;s international manufacturing costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies, the impact of exchange rates is partially mitigated. \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATING EXPENSES \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Revenue . Cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 13.1% in 2000, 13.7% in 2001, and 18.3% in 2002. Cost of revenue in fiscal 2002 increased primarily due to costs related to Xbox. In fiscal 2001, higher support and service costs associated with the MSN Internet access and MSN network services were partially offset by the lower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in the mix of packaged product versus the prior year. Cost of revenue in fiscal 2000 reflected lower costs associated with WebTV Networks&#146; operations, partially offset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development. The discontinuation of goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, offset the growth in headcount and development costs. In fiscal 2001, the increase in R&#38;D expense was the result of higher headcount-related costs and investments in new product initiatives. The increase in fiscal 2000 was driven primarily by higher headcount-related costs. Prospectively, increased headcount and increased spending in Server Platforms, Home &#38; Entertainment, Business Solutions and CE are currently expected to be significant factors affecting future research and development expense growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 18.0% in 2000, 19.3% in 2001, and 19.1% in 2002. In fiscal 2002, sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower relative MSN customer acquisition marketing and the large relative increase associated with the onset of Xbox video game system revenue. In fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative headcount-related costs, higher marketing and sales expenses associated with MSN, the Microsoft Agility advertising campaign, and other new sales initiatives. In fiscal 2000, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs associated with new product releases and online marketing. Microsoft expects that it will increase spending on Information Worker, Server Platforms, and Business Solutions sales forces and Windows Client, MSN and Home &#38; Entertainment marketing. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 increased due to a charge of approximately $660 million for estimated expenses related to the Company&#146;s consumer class action lawsuits and higher legal fees. In fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a charge related to the settlement of the lawsuit with Caldera, Inc. recorded in fiscal 2000. Excluding this charge in fiscal 2000, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001 increased from the prior year due to higher headcount-related costs and legal fees. For fiscal 2000, besides the settlement of the lawsuit, general and administrative expenses also reflected increased legal fees and certain employee stock option-related expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nNON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS), AND INCOME TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\nLosses on equity investees and other consists of Microsoft&#146;s share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method, and income or loss attributable to minority interests. The decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2002 was attributed to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002. The increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an increase in the number of such investments during the year. In fiscal 2000 losses on equity investees and other decreased reflecting smaller losses from the MSNBC entities. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n14 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company recorded net investment income/(loss) in each year as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\nIn Millions \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; \n\nYear Ended June 30 \n\n&#160; 2000 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2001 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2002 \n\n&#160; Dividends \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,231 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,808 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,762 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet recognized gains/(losses) on investments: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net gains on the sales of investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,780 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n3,175 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n2,379 \n\n&#160; \n\nOther-than-temporary impairments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(29 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,804 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(4,323 \n\n) \n\nNet unrealized losses attributable to derivative instruments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(19 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(592 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(480 \n\n) \n\n&#160; &#160; Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,732 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,221 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(2,424 \n\n) \n\n&#160; &#160; Investment income/(loss) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,326 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(36 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n(305 \n\n) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nIn fiscal 2002, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to the Company&#146;s investment in AT&#38;T and other cable and telecommunication investments. Net gains on the sales of investments included a $1.25 billion gain on the sale of the Company&#146;s share of Expedia. Interest and dividend income decreased $66 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of lower interest rates and dividend income. \n\nIn fiscal 2001, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to cable and telecommunication investments. Net gains from the sales of investments in fiscal 2001 included a gain from Microsoft&#146;s investment in Titus Communications (which was merged with Jupiter Telecommunications) and the closing of the sale of Transpoint to CheckFree Holdings Corp. Interest and dividend income increased $591 million from fiscal 2000, reflecting a larger investment portfolio. In fiscal year 2000, investment income increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by cash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities. \n\nAt June 30, 2002, unrealized losses on Equity and Other Investments of $623 million were deemed to be temporary in nature. The following, among other factors, could result in some investments being deemed other-than-temporarily impaired in future periods: changes in the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost; the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors; and the Company&#146;s intent and ability to hold the investment. \n\nIn connection with the definitive agreement to combine AT&#38;T Broadband with Comcast in a new company to be called AT&#38;T Comcast Corporation, Microsoft has agreed to exchange its AT&#38;T 5% convertible preferred debt securities for approximately 115 million shares of AT&#38;T Comcast Corporation. It is expected that the transaction will close by December 31, 2002. While it is possible that Microsoft could incur a loss on this exchange transaction up to the carrying value of the AT&#38;T debt securities, management believes that the ultimate loss, if any, will be significantly less. As management is unable to predict whether there will be a gain or loss on the exchange, no loss has been recorded related to this contingent exchange transaction as of June 30, 2002. \n\nThe Company&#146;s effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 was 32%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 was 33% and 34%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings. \n\n&#160; \n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective July 1, 2001, Microsoft adopted SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. There was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of SFAS 142. Goodwill amortization (on a pre-tax basis) was $234 million in fiscal 2000 and $311 million in fiscal 2001. \n\nEffective July 1, 2000, Microsoft adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). The reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from OCI for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from OCI for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The reduction to OCI was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of OCI of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\n&#160; \n\nThe Company&#146;s cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $38.65 billion at June 30, 2002. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Microsoft&#146;s investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n15 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flow from operations was $14.51 billion for fiscal 2002, an increase of $1.09 billion from fiscal 2001. The increase reflects strong growth in unearned revenue. Cash used for financing was $4.57 billion in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.01 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflects the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year. The Company repurchased 122.8 million shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in fiscal 2002, compared to 89.0 million shares repurchased in the prior year. In addition, 5.1 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction. The Company entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001, giving it the right to acquire 5.1 million of its shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. Cash used for investing was $10.85 billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2.11 billion from fiscal 2001. \n\nCash flow from operations was $13.42 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $2.00 billion from the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital, partially offset by the decrease in the stock option income tax benefit, reflecting decreased stock option exercises by employees. Cash used for financing was $5.59 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $3.39 billion from the prior year. The increase primarily reflects the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001, compared to the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in common stock repurchased. All outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, the Company repurchased 89.0 million shares. Cash used for investing was $8.73 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $658 million from the prior year. In fiscal 2000, cash flow from operations was $11.43 billion, a decrease of $720 million from the prior year, reflecting working capital changes partially offset by the increase in the stock option income tax benefit. Cash used for financing was $2.19 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of $1.33 billion from the prior year, reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year. During fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 55.2 million shares. Cash used for investing was $9.39 billion in fiscal 2000, a decrease of $808 million from the prior year. \n\nMicrosoft has no material long-term debt. Stockholders&#146; equity at June 30, 2002 was $52.18 billion. Microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and product support infrastructure. Additionally, research and development activities will include investments in existing and advanced areas of technology, including using cash to acquire technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&#38;D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $111 million on June 30, 2002. The Company has not engaged in any transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to affect materially liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. Since fiscal 1990, Microsoft has repurchased 982 million common shares while 2.23 billion shares were issued under the Company&#146;s employee stock option and purchase plans. The Company&#146;s convertible preferred stock matured on December 15, 1999. Each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common shares. \n\nManagement believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. The Company&#146;s cash and short-term investments are available for strategic investments, mergers and acquisitions, other potential large-scale needs and to fund the share repurchase program. Microsoft has not paid cash dividends on its common stock. \n\n&#160; \n\nSUBSEQUENT EVENT \n\n&#160; \n\nOn July 11, 2002, Microsoft acquired Navision a/s as a result of the successful close of a tender offer. Microsoft purchased Navision&#146;s shares for approximately $1.45 billion in stock and cash. Navision is a provider of integrated business software solutions for small and medium-sized companies. \n\n&#160; \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft&#146;s financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for Microsoft include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes. \n\nMicrosoft accounts for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of the Company&#146;s products over a period of time. These elements include browser technologies updates and technical support, the fair value of which is recognized over the product&#146;s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product&#146;s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. \n\nSFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, which also requires judgment. In making this judgment, Microsoft evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and the Company&#146;s intent and ability to hold the investment. \n\nMicrosoft accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Other- \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n16 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when the technological feasibility of a product is established. Microsoft has determined that technological feasibility for its products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, the Company expenses all research and development costs when incurred. \n\nMicrosoft is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. The Company evaluates, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact the Company&#146;s financial position or its results of operations. \n\nSFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the Company&#146;s financial position or its results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following issues and uncertainties, among others, should be considered in evaluating the Company&#146;s financial outlook. \n\n&#160; \n\nChallenges to the Company&#146;s Business Model. Since its inception, the Company&#146;s business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by Microsoft. Under this commercial software development (&#147;CSD&#148;) model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products. The Company believes that the CSD model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on the expertise of the Company and other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful, reliable and compatible with other software and hardware. In recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the CSD model, often referred to as the Open Source movement. Under the Open Source model, software is produced by global &#147;communities&#148; of programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at little or no cost. The Company believes that there are significant problems with the Open Source model, the principal drawback being that no single entity is responsible for the Open Source software, and thus users have no recourse if a product does not work properly or at all. Further, without the market incentives associated with the CSD model, the Company believes that the vigorous innovation and growth of the software industry over the last 25 years would not have occurred. Nonetheless, the popularization of the Open Source movement continues to pose a significant challenge to the Company&#146;s business model, including recent efforts by proponents of the Open Source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of Open Source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. To the extent the Open Source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales of the Company&#146;s products may decline, the Company may have to reduce the prices it charges for its products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nNew Products and Services. The Company has made significant investments in research and development for new products, services and technologies, including Microsoft .NET, Xbox, business applications, MSN, mobile and wireless technologies, and television. Significant revenue from these investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, these products and services may never be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced in our Desktop and Enterprise Software and Services businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nDeclines in Demand for Software. If overall market demand for PCs, servers and other computing devices declines significantly, and consumer and corporate spending for such products declines, Microsoft&#146;s revenue growth will be adversely affected. Additionally, the Company&#146;s revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products if such new offerings are not perceived to add significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Development Schedule. The development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products could negatively impact the Company&#146;s revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nInternational Operations. Microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world. The prices of the Company&#146;s products in countries outside of the United States are generally higher than the Company&#146;s prices in the United States because of the cost incurred in localizing software for non-U.S. markets. The costs of producing and selling the Company&#146;s products in these countries also are higher. Pressure to globalize Microsoft&#146;s pricing structure might require that the Company reduce the sales price of its software in other countries, even though the costs of the software continue to be higher than in the United States. Unfavorable changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, including foreign exchange rates; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences, among other factors, could also have a negative effect on the Company&#146;s business and results of operations outside of the United States. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START \n\n17 / MSFT \n\n&#160; 2002 FORM 10-K \n\n##TABLE_END \n\nPart II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nIntellectual Property Rights. Microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use of software represents a loss of revenue to the Company. While this adversely affects U.S. revenue, revenue loss is even more significant outside the United States, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Throughout the world, Microsoft actively educates consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nTaxation of Extraterritorial Income. In August 2001, a World Trade Organization (&#147;WTO&#148;) dispute panel determined that the extraterritorial tax (&#147;ETI&#148;) provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement. The U.S. government appealed the panel&#146;s decision and lost its appeal. On January 29, 2002, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted the Appellate Body report. President Bush has stated the U.S. will bring its tax laws into compliance with the WTO ruling, but the Administration and Congress have not decided on a solution for this issue. In July 2002, Representative Bill Thomas, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced the American Competitiveness and Corporate Accountability Act of 2002. If enacted, that bill would repeal the ETI regime and introduce broad-based international reform. The proposed reforms would not materially affect the Company. On August 30, 2002, a WTO arbitration panel determined that the European Union may impose up to $4.04 billion per year in countermeasures if the U.S. rules are not brought into compliance. The WTO decision does not repeal the ETI tax benefit and it does not require the European Union to impose trade sanctions, so it is not possible to predict what impact the WTO decision will have on future results pending final resolution of these matters. If the ETI exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted, the loss of tax benefit to the Company could be significant. \n\nLitigation. As discussed in Note 19&#151;Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements, the Company is subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. While the Company believes that none of the litigation matters in which the Company is currently involved will have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s financial position or results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that would ultimately have a material adverse impact on the business of the Company, and could negatively impact its revenues and operating margins. \n\n&#160; \n\n"}, "2003": {"item1": " ITEM 1. Business \n\n&#160; \n\nGENERAL \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Corporation was founded as a partnership in 1975 and incorporated in 1981.

These business solutions are sold, implemented, and supported through a partner network consisting of more than 4,500 value added resellers, systems integrators, consultants, ISVs, accounting firms (national, regional, and local), application service providers (ASPs), and eBuilders. Microsoft Business Solutions partners provide strong distribution, marketing, training, and support in the business application customer segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN segment includes MSN Subscriptions and MSN Network services. MSN Subscription services include MSN Internet access and premium services such as MSN Extra Storage, MSN Bill Pay, MSN Radio Plus and MSN Mobile, which are offered to consumers regardless of their Internet Service Provider. The MSN Network delivers online communication services such as email and online instant messaging through its MSN Hotmail and MSN Messenger products. It also delivers popular information services, such as MSN Search and content from top partners like MSNBC, ESPN, Expedia, and Access Hollywood. \n\nThe segment is responsible for building and operating the MSN Network and for delivering MSN Subscription services. Revenue is principally generated from subscribers to MSN&#146;s Internet access and premium services and from advertisers on the MSN Network. MSN delivers its services direct via its MSN Network and through partnerships with network operators such as Verizon, Qwest, Charter Communications, and Bell Canada. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices segment consists of Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive.

Further, the segment manages relationships with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunications, cable and wireless companies and host and network equipment providers. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 2 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart I, Item 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment segment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products. Microsoft Xbox, released in fiscal 2002, is our next-generation video game console system that delivers high quality graphics and audio experiences. We offer several types of entertainment products, including classic software games, online games, simulations, and sport and strategy games. HPD includes Microsoft&#146;s line of consumer hardware and software products, such as the Encarta line of learning products and services, the Picture It! consumer publishing and productivity line of products and services, the Macintosh applications business, and the Microsoft hardware products. \n\nHome and Entertainment segment oversees development and business strategy for the Microsoft Xbox video game system, including hardware, third-party games development, games development published under the Microsoft label, Xbox and Xbox Live operations, marketing, research, and sales and support. The segment leads the development efforts of our HPD product lines. The segment also carries out all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office, the Windows operating systems, Xbox, games, and HPD products. The segment is responsible for the development, sales, and deployment of Microsoft&#146;s TV platform products for the interactive television industry. \n\n&#160; \n\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft develops and sells products throughout the world. Our three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region, the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region, and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. Pressure to globalize our pricing structure might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the United States and other countries. A number of other factors could also have a negative effect on our business and results from operations outside of the United States, including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, including foreign exchange rates; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences. A portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the currency translation exposure. \n\n&#160; \n\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have entered into joint venture arrangements to take advantage of creative talent and content from other organizations. For example, we own 50 percent of MSNBC Cable L.L.C., a 24-hour cable news and information channel, and 50 percent of MSNBC Interactive News L.L.C., an interactive online news service. National Broadcasting Company (NBC) owns the remaining 50 percent of each of these joint ventures. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, research and development expense was $4.38 billion, $4.31 billion, and $4.66 billion, respectively. Those amounts represented 17.3%, 15.2%, and 14.5%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years. During fiscal year 2001, $272 million of goodwill amortization was included in research and development expense. No goodwill amortization is included in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We plan to continue spending significant amounts for research and product development. \n\nMost of our software products are developed internally. We also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products. We do not believe we are materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products. Internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products and gives us the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We work to devise innovative solutions in computer science, such as making computers easier to use, designing software for the next generation of hardware, improving the software design process, and investigating the mathematical underpinnings of computer science. We have created a substantial body of development tools and have evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing our products. These tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product&#146;s portability among different operating systems, microprocessors, and computing devices. Product documentation is generally created internally. We strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide to application vendors a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. \n\nMicrosoft .NET is our strategy and implementation of connecting people, information, systems and devices through the use of Web services. It includes everything needed to develop and deploy a Web service-connected IT architecture: servers to host Web services (Windows Server System and Windows Server 2003), development tools to create them (Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 and the .NET Framework), applications and smart devices that use them (Microsoft Office System, smart phones, Pocket PCs and PCs), and a worldwide network of more than 35,000 Microsoft Certified Partner organizations &#150; people whose skills and experience can help businesses get the most from their IT investments. Built on industry standards, Web services enable applications to communicate and share data over the Internet or an intranet, regardless of operating system or programming language. \n\nWe believe that establishing trust in computing will be critical to our future success. Trustworthy Computing means helping ensure a safe and reliable computing experience that is both expected and taken for granted. Achieving Trustworthy Computing will require the collaboration of hardware and software companies, academic and government research institutions, and policy leaders. For us, Trustworthy Computing is a company-wide initiative aimed at changing how we do business that will take fundamental research and advances in engineering, as well as changes to business culture and business processes to accomplish. We think there are four factors that affect the level of trust that people place in computing: Security, Privacy, Reliability, and Business Integrity. Security means the customer can expect that systems are resilient to attack, and that the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data are protected. Privacy means the customer is able to control personal information and feel confident it is not only safe and used appropriately, but in a way that provides value. A reliable system or \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 3 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart I, Item 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nservice is one the customer can depend on to fulfill its functions. Business Integrity involves being responsive to customers, addressing problems effectively with products or services, and being transparent and responsive in customer interactions. \n\nTo serve the needs of users around the world, we &#147;localize&#148; many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the quality and usability of the product in international markets. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. \n\n&#160; \n\nMANUFACTURING \n\n&#160; \n\nWe contract out most of our manufacturing activities to third parties. Outside manufacturers produce the Xbox, various retail software packaged products, and hardware. Our products may include some components that are available from only one or from limited sources. Key components that are currently obtained from a single source include the Xbox central processing unit (CPU) from Intel Corporation and the Xbox graphics processing unit (GPU) from NVIDIA Corporation. With the exception of the Xbox CPU and GPU, we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current manufacturing vendor becomes unavailable. We generally have multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and the greater Seattle area. The centers support all operations in their regions, including information processing and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Dublin, Ireland supports the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region, the center in Singapore supports the Japan and Asia-Pacific region, and the center in the greater Seattle area supports North and South America. Microsoft Licensing, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary in Reno, Nevada, manages our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and certain organizational licensing operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES AND MARKETING \n\n&#160; \n\nWe distribute our products primarily through the following channels: OEM; distributors and resellers; and online services and products. Our three major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the Americas Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; and the Japan and Asia-Pacific Region. \n\n&#160; \n\nOEM \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of our products with their computing devices, principally PCs. We also market and license certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software products to OEMs under similar arrangements. We have OEM agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including Acer, Actebis, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Gateway, HP, IBM, NEC, Samsung, Siemens Computers, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors. \n\n&#160; \n\nDistributors and Resellers \n\n&#160; \n\nWe distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers and retail outlets. Organizations license our products primarily through Large Account Resellers (LARs), Direct Market Resellers (DMRs), and value added resellers. Many organizations that license products through Enterprise Agreements (EAs) now transact directly with us with sales support from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. These Enterprise Software Advisors are also typically authorized as LARs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs. Although all of our types of reselling partners reach organizations of all sizes, LARs are primarily engaged with large organizations and value added resellers typically reach the breadth of small and medium sized organizations. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include Software Spectrum, Software House International, Dell, CDW, and Insight Enterprises. Individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets including Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel who solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. \n\nWe license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the end-user customer to acquire multiple licenses of product. These arrangements are designed to provide organizations with a means of acquiring multiple licenses, without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nOpen. Targeted at small to medium organizations, this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, rights to future versions of software products, over a specified time period (generally two years). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of software product is called Software Assurance. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Under the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only or licenses with Software Assurance. They can also renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelect. Targeted at medium to large organizations, this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, Software Assurance, which consists of rights to future versions of software products, support, tools, and training, over a specified time period (generally three years). Similar to the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Agreement. The Enterprise Agreement is targeted at large organizations that want to acquire perpetual licenses to software products for their entire enterprise along with rights to future versions of software products over a three year period. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 4 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart I, Item 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Subscription Agreement. The Enterprise Subscription Agreement (ESA) is a time-based, multi-year licensing arrangement. Under an ESA, customers acquire the right to use the current version of software products and the future versions that are released during the three year term of the arrangement. At the end of the arrangement term, customers may either renew their ESA arrangement or exercise a buy-out option to obtain perpetual licenses for the latest version of the covered products. If they do not elect one of these options, then all covered software must be uninstalled. \n\n&#160; \n\nOnline Services and Products \n\n&#160; \n\nWe distribute online content and services through MSN Subscription services, MSN Network services, bCentral small business portal, and other online services. MSN Subscription services deliver Internet access and other premium services and tools to consumers. MSN Network services deliver online email and messaging communication services as well as information services such as online search and premium content. The bCentral portal provides tools and expertise for small business owners to build, market and manage their businesses online. Other services delivered online include Microsoft Developer Networks (MSDN) subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling Microsoft products and solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nCUSTOMERS \n\n&#160; \n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small- and medium-size organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet Service Providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small- and medium-size organizations obtain Microsoft products primarily through resellers and OEMs. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2001, 2002, or 2003. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nCOMPETITION \n\n&#160; \n\nThe software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements, and changing business models. We face significant competition in all areas of our current business activities. The rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. Customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive, and as emerging concerns such as security and privacy become of paramount concern. We face direct competition with firms adopting alternative business models to the commercial software model. Firms adopting the Open Source model typically provide customers with Open Source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the Open Source software. Additionally, global software piracy &#150; the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products &#150; deprives us of large amounts of revenue on an annual basis. Further, the existing versions of our products licensed to our installed base of users compete with future versions. This means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product. \n\nOur competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient \n\n&#160; \n\nAlthough we are the leader in operating system software products, we face strong competition from well established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market. Competing commercial software products, including variants of Unix, are supplied by competitors, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and others, who are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. Personal computer OEMs who preinstall third party operating systems may also license these firms&#146; operating systems or Open Source software, especially offerings based on Linux. Variants of Unix run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems, in part due to the increasing performance of standard hardware components at decreasing prices. The Linux open source operating system, which is also derived from Unix and is available without payment under a General Public License, has gained increasing acceptance as its feature set increasingly resembles the distinct and innovative features of Windows and as competitive pressures on personal computer OEMs to reduce costs continue to increase. The Microsoft Windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms such as those based on Internet browsing software and Java technology promoted by Sun Microsystems, as well as innovative form factors that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers. We believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering better innovation, overall value, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, and the largest support network for any operating system. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160; \n\nOur server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications offered by firms with a variety of market approaches. Several vertically integrated computer manufacturers, such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and others offer their own variant of Unix preinstalled on server hardware, and virtually all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system. IBM&#146;s endorsement of Linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional Unix and Windows server operating systems. Linux&#146;s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers as well as Open Source community developers. A number of companies supply versions of Linux, including Red Hat and VA Linux. \n\nWe compete in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions as well as middleware technology platforms. IBM and Sun Microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for the PC-based \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 5 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart I, Item 1 \n\n&#160; \n\ndistributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer Associates, Sybase, and Informix. There are also a number of Open Source server applications available. \n\nNumerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, and e-business servers. Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with our collaboration and email products. There are also a significant number of Open Source software products that compete with Microsoft solutions, including Apache Web Server. \n\nThe Open Source model of Linux and other server programs enables both services and hardware companies to provide customers with Open Source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complimentary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the Open Source software. For example, IBM, with the largest hardware and services businesses in the industry, promotes Linux extensively and seeks to earn revenues and profits on the sale of its consulting services to implement the Linux server solution as well as related hardware and commercial software products that run on Linux. \n\nOur developer products compete against offerings from BEA Systems, Borland, IBM, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Sybase, and other companies. \n\nWe believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation, performance (both relative to total costs of ownership and in absolute terms), productivity, applications development tools and environment, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker \n\n&#160; \n\nWhile we are the leader in business productivity software applications, competitors to the Microsoft Office System include many software application vendors, such as Apple, Corel, IBM, Oracle, QUALCOMM, Sun Microsystems, and local application developers in Europe and Asia. IBM and Corel have significant installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, Apple and IBM preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with our applications. Corel&#146;s suite and Sun Microsystems&#146; Star Office are aggressively priced and attractive for OEMs to pre-install on low-priced PCs. The OpenOffice.org project provides a freely downloadable cross-platform application that is gaining popularity in certain market segments. In addition to traditional client-side applications, web-based applications hosting services such as SimDesk provide an alternative to Microsoft Office and are gaining some support. We believe that our products compete effectively by providing customers significant benefits, such as easy-to-use personal productivity, support for effective teaming and collaboration, and better information management and control. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; \n\nThe small and mid-market business applications market globally is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors. We face competition from a large number of companies in this business. Well-known vendors focused on small and mid-market business, such as Intuit and Sage, compete against us for a portion of this segment. In addition, large-enterprise focused vendors, such as Oracle, Peoplesoft and SAP, also compete against us for a portion of this segment. However, the competition for a significant majority of the total business applications market includes thousands of much smaller vendors in specific localities or industries who offer their own enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, and/or analytic solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN competes with AOL-Time Warner, Google, Yahoo!, and a vast array of Web sites and portals that offer content of all types, such as email, instant messaging, calendaring, chat, search, and shopping services. As the broadband access market grows, we expect to have increasing opportunity to deliver premium subscription services for consumers. AOL and Yahoo! are both pursuing similar strategies and will be competitors in this emerging category. While the movement to broadband access may cause our Internet Access dial-up business to continue to decline, we will strive to convert customers to MSN premium subscription services via partnerships with network providers and Internet software services offered directly from MSN. We believe our strengths are our heritage of technology innovation, particularly in communication services, distribution partnerships, and the large base of users of our free MSN Network. Additionally, while our advertising business has grown considerably over the last year, evolving market conditions, particularly paid search, will impact our strategy over the next year. We currently are building our own search engine and investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; \n\nWindows Mobile software faces substantial competition from Nokia, Openwave Systems, PalmSource, QUALCOMM, and Symbian. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. Key competitors include IBM, Wind River, and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors, such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software. MapPoint competitors include DeLorme, MapInfo, Mapquest.com, Rand McNally, Webraska Mobile Technologies, and Yahoo!. The telematics market is also highly fragmented, with competitive offerings from IBM and automotive suppliers building on various real-time operating system platforms from commercial Linux vendors, QNX Software Systems, Wind River, and others. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\nThe home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles, frequent introductions of new products and titles, and the development of new technologies. The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition, and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors. These pressures have, from time to time, required us to reduce prices on certain products. Our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality and variety, timing of product releases, and effectiveness of distribution and marketing. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 6 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart I, Item 1, 2, 3, 4 \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large established base of users. In addition to competing against software published for non-Xbox platforms, our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by Microsoft to develop and publish software for the Xbox console. These competitors include Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, Electronic Arts, Sega, Take-Two Interactive, Tecmo, THQ, and Ubi Soft, among others. Success in the games business is increasingly driven by hit titles, which are difficult to develop and require substantial investments in development and marketing. In addition, other forms of entertainment, such as music, motion pictures, and television, compete against our entertainment software for consumer spending. Our PC hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners. \n\n&#160; \n\nEMPLOYEES \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of June 30, 2003, we employed approximately 55,000 people on a full-time basis, 36,500 in the United States and 18,500 internationally. Of the total, 23,200 were in product research and development, 25,100 in sales, marketing, and support, 2,400 in manufacturing and distribution, and 4,300 in finance and administration. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software industry. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit qualified employees, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be as successful in the future. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent. \n\n&#160; \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com.

Revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multi-year licensing that occurred before the transition to our new licensing program (Licensing 6.0) in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Prior to the July 31, 2002 transition date to Licensing 6.0, we experienced significant growth in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs, including Upgrade Advantage and Software Assurance. The revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from Microsoft Xbox video game consoles. Revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of $1.35 billion of Xbox video game system revenue and $1.20 billion of revenue growth from Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Home operating systems. Revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by licensing of Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional with $1.01 billion growth in revenue from Professional operating systems, and Server and Tools revenue growth of $852 million. \n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2002, we launched a new licensing program, Licensing 6.0, for volume licensing customers. Licensing 6.0 simplifies and improves our volume licensing program with Software Assurance, which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage. The level of customer adoption of our new volume licensing programs will affect the mix of multi-year licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition. In addition, the timing and extent of a recovery in consumer and corporate spending on PCs and information technology will be factors affecting revenue growth. \n\n&#160; \n\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating income grew 6% in fiscal 2001, 2% in fiscal 2002, and 11% in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.82 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $2.52 billion in operating expenses, primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses. In fiscal 2002, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.07 billion in revenue, substantially offset by an increase of $2.88 billion in operating expenses, which included the onset of costs related to Xbox video game systems. In fiscal 2001, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $2.34 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $1.63 billion in operating expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nSEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) \n\n&#160; \n\nWe revised our segments for fiscal year 2003. Our seven segments are: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Client ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Server and Tools ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Information Worker ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Microsoft Business Solutions ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; MSN ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Mobile and Embedded Devices ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; Home and Entertainment ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this MD&#38;A are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Segment Information appearing in Note 21 of the Notes to Financial Statements are presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table presents our segment revenue and operating income, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; Revenue &#160; Operating Income/(Loss) &#160; Year Ended June 30 &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; Client \n\n&#160; $ 9,360 &#160; $ 10,394 &#160; $ 7,576 &#160; &#160; $ 8,400 &#160; Server and Tools \n\n&#160; &#160; 6,157 &#160; &#160; 7,140 &#160; &#160; 2,048 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,457 &#160; Information Worker \n\n&#160; &#160; 8,212 &#160; &#160; 9,229 &#160; &#160; 6,448 &#160; &#160; &#160; 7,037 &#160; Microsoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; &#160; 308 &#160; &#160; 567 &#160; &#160; (176 ) &#160; &#160; (254 ) MSN \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,571 &#160; &#160; 1,953 &#160; &#160; (641 ) &#160; &#160; (299 ) Mobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; &#160; 112 &#160; &#160; 156 &#160; &#160; (157 ) &#160; &#160; (157 ) Home and Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,453 &#160; &#160; 2,748 &#160; &#160; (874 ) &#160; &#160; (924 ) Other \n\n&#160; &#160; 192 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; &#160; (2,314 ) &#160; &#160; (3,043 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; Consolidated \n\n&#160; $ 28,365 &#160; $ 32,187 &#160; $ 11,910 &#160; &#160; $ 13,217 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nClient \n\n&#160; \n\nClient revenue was $8.17 billion, $9.36 billion, and $10.39 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Client includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. In 2003, Client revenue growth was driven by OEM licensing revenue growth of $933 million and a 9 percentage point increase of the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel. Windows Professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was $1.59 billion or 31% compared to fiscal 2002, partially offset by a $573 million decline in revenue of \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 10 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nearlier versions of Windows operating systems. Client operating profit for fiscal 2003 increased 11% primarily as a result of the 11% growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, the growth in Client revenue reflected strong multi-year licensing revenue growth and a continued shift of sales to the higher priced Windows 2000 and Windows XP Professional operating system licensed through OEMs. OEM revenue grew $939 million, despite a 5% decline in reported OEM unit shipments. Fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of Windows 2000 Professional with professional operating systems revenue growth of $1.01 billion and a 7 percentage point mix increase to the higher priced Windows 2000 Professional and Windows NT Workstation operating systems, and a $91 million increase in revenue from Windows Me and Windows 98 operating systems. \n\nWe do not expect the revenue growth attributed to the mix toward the higher priced Windows Professional operating system to continue at previous levels into fiscal 2004. Additionally, variability between the reported OEM unit shipments and the underlying PC Market may continue as a result of the transition to new OEM licensing terms at the beginning of fiscal year 2003, under which OEMs are billed upon their acquisition of Certificates of Authenticity (COAs) rather than upon the shipment of PCs to their customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools revenue was $5.84 billion, $6.16 billion, and $7.14 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Server and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Total Server and Tools revenue grew $983 million or 16% in fiscal 2003, driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Server revenue, including CALs, grew $787 million or 18% from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $91 million or 10% compared to fiscal 2002. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services increased $105 million or 13%. Server operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 20%, primarily as a result of the 16% increase in revenue. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, Server and Tools revenue increased 5% compared to fiscal 2001. Server revenue, including CALs, increased 9% versus fiscal 2001, driven by a 5% overall increase in Windows-based server shipments and increased deployment of Windows 2000 Server. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue was up $137 million or 17% compared to fiscal 2001, while revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press and other services was down $183 million or 18% from fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, Server and Tools revenue increased $852 million or 17% versus the prior year, as a result of the continued adoption of the Microsoft Enterprise Server offerings. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker revenue was $8.42 billion, $8.21 billion, and $9.23 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Information Worker includes revenue from Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Visio, other information worker products, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, and professional product support services. The $1.02 billion or 12% increase in Information Worker revenue in fiscal year 2003 compared to fiscal 2002, was primarily due to growth in Office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements and a $264 million or 28% increase in revenue from the combined total of Project, Visio, and other standalone applications. Information Worker operating profit for fiscal year 2003 grew 9% compared to fiscal year 2002 led by the 12% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 24% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, Information Worker licensing revenue declined $228 million or 3% during the year due to a shift in the sales mix to multi-year licensing agreements, which deferred revenue recognition to future years, and a $294 million or 14% decrease in consumer purchases in the Asia-Pacific region, most notably Japan, partially offset by a $189 million or 22% growth in OEM licensing revenue. In fiscal 2001, Information Worker revenue growth was less than 1% or $30 million. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions revenue was $106 million, $308 million, and $567 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Microsoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Navision, and bCentral. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $259 million from fiscal 2002, of which $246 million was attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased 44%, primarily due to operating losses associated with Navision, increases in sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and acquisition related costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN revenue was $1.32 billion, $1.57 billion, and $1.95 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. MSN includes MSN Subscriptions and MSN Network services. Although total MSN subscribers at the end of fiscal 2003 were flat compared to the end of fiscal 2002, MSN Subscriptions revenue grew $112 million or 11% in fiscal year 2003 reflecting an increase in the number of non-promotion subscribers. MSN Network services revenue grew $270 million or 48% in fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong general advertising sales across all geographic regions. MSN operating loss for fiscal 2003 decreased 53%, primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, MSN Subscriptions revenue increased $229 million or 29% as a result of both a higher subscriber base and higher average revenue per subscriber due to a reduction in promotional subscriber programs. Revenue from MSN Network services increased $27 million or 5% led by online advertising. In fiscal 2001, revenue from MSN Network services grew $197 million or 58% led by online advertising. MSN Subscriptions revenue also grew $141 million or 22% from fiscal 2000 as a result of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted under rebate programs. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 11 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices revenue was $86 million, $112 million, and $156 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Mobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. Revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $44 million driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing. Operating loss for fiscal 2003 was flat with the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount-related costs associated with product development offset the growth in revenue. Prior year revenue and operating loss for Mobile and Embedded Devices have been restated to reflect the reorganizations of MapPoint from Information Worker and Windows embedded device operating systems from Client to Mobile and Embedded Devices. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment revenue was $1.14 billion, $2.45 billion, and $2.75 billion in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Home &#38; Entertainment includes the Xbox video game system, PC games, consumer software and hardware, and TV platform. Home and Entertainment revenue increased $295 million, as a result of sales of Xbox video game systems and related games which were available for all of fiscal 2003. Xbox revenue grew $309 million or 23% in fiscal 2003 reflecting a $779 million increase from higher volumes for Xbox consoles, games, and peripherals partially offset by a $470 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $14 million or 1% in fiscal 2003. Operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased 6% from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased Xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the 12% increase in revenue. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, Home and Entertainment revenue growth from fiscal 2001 stemmed from $1.35 billion of sales of the Xbox video game system released in fiscal 2002. Learning and productivity software revenue and PC and online games declined $39 million or 3% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. In fiscal 2001, Home and Entertainment revenue declined $214 million or 16% from fiscal 2002. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nRevenue in the Other segment represents our majority ownership of Expedia, Inc., which was sold in February 2002, resulting in a decline in revenue from fiscal 2001. Acquisitions of Travelscape.com and VacationSpot.com by Expedia, Inc. in fiscal 2001 and increased product offerings from Expedia led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2001. \n\nOperating loss includes Expedia, Inc. revenue and operating expenses, general and administrative expenses ($1.55 billion in 2002 and $2.10 billion in 2003), broad-based research and development expenses ($202 million in 2002 and $210 million in 2003), and certain corporate level sales and marketing costs ($526 million in 2002 and $688 million in 2003). \n\n&#160; \n\nForeign Currencies Impact \n\n&#160; \n\nOur operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates. Approximately 27%, 25%, and 28% of our revenue was collected in foreign currencies during 2001, 2002, and 2003. Had the rates from fiscal 2002 been in effect in fiscal 2003, translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been approximately $700 million lower. Certain manufacturing, selling distribution and support costs are disbursed in local currencies, and a portion of international revenue is hedged, thus offsetting a portion of the translation exposure. \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATING EXPENSES \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Revenue \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. Cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 13.7% in 2001, 18.3% in 2002, and 17.7% in 2003. For fiscal 2003, cost of revenue was $5.69 billion compared to $5.19 billion in fiscal 2002. The primary driver of the decrease as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2003 was a 0.2 percentage point decrease from Home and Entertainment products due to lower volumes and improved margins of Xbox video game consoles and a 0.4 percentage point decrease from MSN product and service costs in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. \n\nCost of revenue in fiscal 2002 was $5.19 billion compared to $3.46 billion in fiscal 2001. The increase as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2002 was due to an increase of 5.3 percentage points from Home and Entertainment primarily due to costs related to Xbox, partially offset by a 0.7 percentage point decrease due to a higher mix of revenue from licensing business. In fiscal 2001, cost of revenue was $3.46 billion, an increase of $453 million compared to fiscal 2000. The higher sales associated with MSN Subscription and MSN Network services resulting in increased support and service costs drove 0.4 of the 0.6 percentage point increase in total costs as a percentage of revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2003 were $4.66 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2002. The increase reflects a 7% increase in headcount-related costs, a 25% increase in third-party product development costs, and a 29% increase in testing laboratory equipment and expense. In fiscal 2002, research and development expenses were $4.31 billion compared to $4.38 billion in fiscal 2001. The decrease from fiscal 2001 was due to the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill in accordance with SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, $272 million which offset the 15% growth in headcount-related costs. In fiscal 2001, research and development expenses were $4.38 billion, an increase of 16% compared to fiscal 2000. The increase in research and development expenses resulted from a 11% increase in headcount-related costs and a 23% increase in investments in new product development. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 12 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and Marketing \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue was 19.3% in 2001, 19.1% in 2002, and 20.3% in 2003. Sales and marketing expenses were $6.52 billion in 2003, compared to $5.41 billion in fiscal 2002. The increase in absolute dollars was due to a 20% increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally related to the Enterprise and Small/Medium Business sales forces, and a 21% increase in marketing expenses. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, sales and marketing expenses were $5.41 billion, an increase of 11% from fiscal 2001. The sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars increased due to a 20% increase in headcount-related costs partially offset by a 25% decline in MSN customer acquisition marketing costs and a 4% decline in all other marketing costs. In fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses were $4.89 billion compared to $4.13 billion in fiscal 2000. The 18% increase in sales and marketing from fiscal 2000 was primarily due to a 21% growth in headcount-related costs, and to a lesser extent, a 3% growth in higher marketing and sales expenses associated with MSN and other new sales initiatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, other administrative headcount, and legal and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 increased $554 million due to a charge of $750 million related to a settlement with AOL/Time Warner in the fourth quarter of 2003 and also due to a $256 million charge reflecting an increase in our estimate of costs related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits. General and administrative expenses in fiscal 2002 increased due to a charge of approximately $660 million for estimated expenses related to resolving pending state antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits and a 10% increase in headcount-related costs. In fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a lawsuit settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2000, partially offset by a 3% growth in headcount-related costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nNON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS), AND INCOME TAXES \n\n&#160; \n\nNon-operating items \n\n&#160; \n\nLosses on equity investees and other consist of our share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method, and income or loss attributable to minority interests. The decrease in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2003 and 2002 was due to the divestiture of certain equity investments in fiscal 2002 in conjunction with the underlying performance of such entities. The increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflected an increase in the number of such investments during the year. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nWe recorded net investment income/(loss) in each year as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Year Ended June 30 &#160; 2001 &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; Dividends \n\n&#160; $ 377 &#160; &#160; $ 357 &#160; &#160; $ 260 &#160; Interest \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,808 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,762 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,697 &#160; Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net gains on the sales of investments \n\n&#160; &#160; 3,175 &#160; &#160; &#160; 2,379 &#160; &#160; &#160; 909 &#160; Other-than-temporary impairments \n\n&#160; &#160; (4,804 ) &#160; &#160; (4,323 ) &#160; &#160; (1,148 ) Net unrealized losses attributable to derivative instruments \n\n&#160; &#160; (592 ) &#160; &#160; (480 ) &#160; &#160; (141 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Net recognized gains/(losses) on investments \n\n&#160; &#160; (2,221 ) &#160; &#160; (2,424 ) &#160; &#160; (380 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment income/(loss) \n\n&#160; $ (36 ) &#160; $ (305 ) &#160; $ 1,577 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. \n\nIn fiscal 2003, other-than-temporary impairments decreased mainly due to the lack of significant continued impairments in the cable and telecommunications sectors. Interest income decreased $65 million due to declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio. Dividend income decreased $97 million primarily related to the exchange of AT&#38;T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of AT&#38;T Corporation during the year. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to our investment in AT&#38;T and other cable and telecommunication investments. Net gains on the sales of investments included a $1.25 billion gain on sale of our share of Expedia. Interest and dividend income decreased $66 million from fiscal 2001 as a result of lower interest rates and dividend income. \n\nIn fiscal 2001, other-than-temporary impairments primarily related to cable and telecommunication investments. Net gains from the sales of investments in fiscal 2001 included a gain from our investment in Titus Communications (which was merged with Jupiter Telecommunications) and the closing of the sale of Transpoint to CheckFree Holdings Corp. Interest and dividend income increased $591 million from fiscal 2000, reflecting a larger investment portfolio. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 13 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 32%, reflecting a one-time benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes. The tax reversal stems from a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in December 2002 overturning a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002 was 33% and 32%, respectively. \n\n&#160; \n\nACCOUNTING CHANGES \n\n&#160; \n\nEffective July 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . SFAS 141 requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. It also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill. SFAS 142 requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least annually. There was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of SFAS 142. Goodwill amortization (on a pre-tax basis) was $311 million in fiscal 2001. \n\nEffective July 1, 2000, we adopted SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities. The adoption of SFAS 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI) of $112 million ($75 million after-tax). The reduction to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from OCI for the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified from OCI for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. The reduction to OCI was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of OCI of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. \n\n&#160; \n\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION \n\n&#160; \n\nOn July 8, 2003, we announced changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Employees will be granted Stock Awards instead of stock options. The Stock Award program offers employees the opportunity to earn actual shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. As part of the changes, we announced that a significant portion of stock-based compensation for more than 600 of our senior leaders will depend on growth in the number and satisfaction of our customers. We also indicated that we are working on a plan to enable employees to realize some value on the portion of their stock options that are currently out-of-the-money, by selling their options to a third-party financial institution. If approved, we expect to implement this plan by the end of 2003. \n\nIn addition to announcing changes to our employee compensation arrangements, we also indicated that we will adopt the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, effective July 1, 2003, and will report that change in accounting principle using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#151;Transition and Disclosure . Note 16 of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides pro forma income statements for 2001, 2002, and 2003 as if compensation cost for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans had been determined as prescribed by SFAS 123. \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\n&#160; \n\nOur cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $49.05 billion at June 30, 2003, an increase of $10.40 billion from fiscal year 2002. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. \n\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2003 was $9.02 billion, increasing $1.27 billion from June 30, 2002, reflecting the addition of new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements, partially offset by continued recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing in prior periods. \n\nCash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal 2002. The increase reflects a $2.16 billion increase in net income from fiscal year 2002 and an increase of $1.37 billion in unearned revenue, offset by an increase of $2.36 billion in recognition of unearned revenue. Cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal 2003, an increase of $651 million from the prior year. The increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417 million in common stock repurchase, offsetting $623 million received for common stock issued. We repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003. Cash used for investing was $7.21 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of $3.63 billion from fiscal 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments. \n\nCash flow from operations was $14.51 billion for fiscal 2002, an increase of $1.09 billion from fiscal 2001. The increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased Upgrade Advantage during the Licensing 6.0 transition period. This resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount. Cash used for financing was $4.57 billion in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.01 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year. We repurchased 245.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002. In addition, 10.2 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction. We entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001, which gave us the right to acquire 10.2 million of our shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. Cash used for investing was $10.85 billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2.11 billion from fiscal 2001. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 14 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flow from operations was $13.42 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $2.00 billion from the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital, partially offset by a decrease in the stock option income tax benefit, reflecting decreased stock option exercises by employees. Cash used for financing was $5.59 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of $3.39 billion from the prior year. The increase primarily reflected the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001, compared to the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in common stock repurchased. All outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised during fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, we repurchased 178.1 million shares. Cash used for investing was $8.73 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $658 million from the prior year. \n\nWe have no material long-term debt. Stockholders&#146; equity at June 30, 2003 was $61.02 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for R&#38;D, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $117 million on June 30, 2003. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources. \n\nWe believe existing cash and short-term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment. Rental expense for operating leases was $281 million, $318 million, and $290 million in 2001, 2002, and 2003, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars, are: 2004, $218; 2005, $202; 2006, $172; 2007, $134; 2008, $116; and thereafter, $429. \n\nWe have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter&#146;s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $10.5 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter&#146;s assets. The proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation. \n\nIn connection with various operating leases, we issued residual value guarantees, which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2003, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists. \n\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies , as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\n&#160; \n\nIn January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. In general, a variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust, or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Interpretation 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity&#146;s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity&#146;s residual returns or both. The consolidation requirements of Interpretation 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements apply to transactions entered into prior to February 1, 2003 in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of the Interpretation on July 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS 133. The Statement is effective (with certain exceptions) for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. We do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. The Statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 15 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\ncharacteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). It is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. While we do not believe the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on our financial statements, we continue to assess the impact this Statement will have on certain of our share repurchase programs. \n\n&#160; \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes. \n\nWe account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product&#146;s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product&#146;s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. \n\nSFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. \n\nSFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 st for Microsoft) and between annual tests in certain circumstances. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. Significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nWe account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. \n\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies , requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. We evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. \n\nSFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES \n\n&#160; \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report, which, among others, should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook. \n\n&#160; \n\nChallenges to our Business Model \n\n&#160; \n\nSince our inception, our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us. Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products. We believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 16 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7 \n\n&#160; \n\ninnovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. In recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model, often referred to as the Open Source model. Under the Open Source model, software is produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at substantially no cost. The most notable example of Open Source software is the Linux operating system. While we believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than Open Source software, the popularization of the Open Source model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents of the Open Source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of Open Source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. To the extent the Open Source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntellectual Property Rights \n\n&#160; \n\nWe defend our intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us. While this adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the United States is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue. \n\nFrom time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow. Responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. \n\nWe have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses of broad patent portfolios. \n\n&#160; \n\nNew Products and Services \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have made significant investments in research, development and marketing for new products, services and technologies, including Microsoft .NET, Xbox, business applications, MSN, mobile and wireless technologies, and television. Significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, these products and services may never be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced by us. \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation \n\n&#160; \n\nAs discussed in Note 20 &#150; Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. While we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that ultimately would have a material adverse impact on our business, and could negatively impact our revenues, operating margins, and net income. \n\n&#160; \n\nDeclines in Demand for Software \n\n&#160; \n\nIf overall market demand for PCs, servers and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Additionally, our revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. A significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to Licensing 6.0 in July 2002. These agreements will expire in 2004 and 2005 and the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenues. We are also committing significant investments in the next release of the Windows operating system, codenamed Longhorn. If this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers, our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Development Schedule \n\n&#160; \n\nThe development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, particularly any delays in the Longhorn operating system, could adversely affect our revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral Economic and Geo-Political Risks \n\n&#160; \n\nContinued softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenues. Terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our international operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompetition \n\n&#160; \n\nWe continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenues, gross margins and operating income. \n\n&#160; \n\nTaxation of Extraterritorial Income \n\n&#160; \n\nIn August 2001, a World Trade Organization (&#147;WTO&#148;) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 (&#147;ETI&#148;) constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START 17 / MSFT &#160; 2003 FORM 10-K ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nPart II, Item 7, 7A \n\n&#160; \n\nand Countervailing Measures. The U.S. government appealed the panel&#146;s decision and lost its appeal. If the ETI provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted, the loss of the ETI tax benefit to us could be significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Potential Tax Liabilities \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinite Insurance Programs \n\n&#160; \n\nIn addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2003, potential coverage available under captive insurance arrangements was $1.0 billion, subject to deductibles, exclusions, and other restrictions. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks, the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed herein could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther \n\n&#160; \n\nOther issues and uncertainties may include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; warranty and other claims for hardware products such as Xbox; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; the effects of the Consent Decree in U.S. v. Microsoft and Final Judgment in State of New York v. Microsoft on the Windows operating system and server business, including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required by the Decree and Final Judgment and the ability of PC manufacturers to hide end user access to certain new Windows features; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; the continued availability of third party distribution channels for MSN service and other online services; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; factors associated with our international operations, as described under International Operations in Part I, Item 1 of this report; and ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#183; &#160; financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments, such as the Comcast Corporation securities held by us, that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n"}, "2004": {"item1": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\n&#160; \n\nGENERAL \n\n&#160; \n\nOver the last three decades, technology has transformed the way people work, play, and communicate. Today, people access information and communicate with individuals from around the world in an instant. Groundbreaking technologies have opened the door to innovations in every field of human endeavor, delivering new opportunity, convenience, and value to people&#146;s lives. Since our founding in 1975, we have been a leader in this transformation. As a reflection of that role, and to help us focus on the opportunities that lie ahead we have established a new corporate mission: To enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT SEGMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nOur product segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments provide a framework for the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and for the timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. The segments also help focus strategic planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives across our broad businesses. \n\nThe product segments are designed to allocate resources internally and provide a framework to determine management responsibility. Due to our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Therefore, these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss that is directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to incent shared effort. Due to our integrated business structure, segments should not be viewed as discrete or easily separable businesses. \n\nOur seven product segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. See Note 18 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements for financial information regarding segment reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient. The Client segment has overall responsibility for product delivery, engineering, and technical architecture for the Microsoft Windows operating system and new media technology, as well as our relationships with manufacturers of personal computers, including multinational and regional original equipment manufacturer (OEM) accounts. The segment includes sales and marketing expenses for the Windows Client operating system and product development efforts for the Windows platform. \n\nThe Client segment includes Windows XP and other standard Windows operating systems. Windows XP extends the personal computing experience by uniting PCs, devices, and services, while enhancing reliability, security, and performance. With emerging form factors such as the Tablet PC and Media Center, and with investments in technology such as Windows Media, we believe the &#147;Windows PC&#148; continues to evolve with innovations that enable people to use computers in more ways, in more places, and more often than ever before. \n\nWindows XP Home Edition is designed for individuals or families and includes capabilities for digital photo, music, video, home networking, and communications. Windows XP Professional, designed for business users and people who demand the most from their computing experience, includes all the features of Home Edition, along with advanced security, performance, manageability, and multilingual features to help customers improve their productivity and connectivity. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition meets the demands of specialized technical workstation users. \n\nThe next generation of the Windows operating system, code-named Longhorn, is currently under development. This development phase represents a significant investment for the Client business and is expected to result in a product that is more manageable and deployable for both our business and consumer markets. While all features and functions have not been finalized, Longhorn will include significant advances in security, digital media, user interfaces, and other areas that are expected to enhance the user and developer experience. We are targeting broad availability of this operating system in calendar year 2006. We are also developing a Windows storage subsystem, which will provide advanced data organization and management capabilities, that we plan to deliver subsequent to the Longhorn operating system introduction. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 1 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools. The Server and Tools segment has overall responsibility for integrated product development and marketing of Windows Server System products, including building and marketing Windows Server operating systems. Windows Server System is integrated server infrastructure software that is designed to support end-to-end solutions built on the Windows Server 2003 operating system. In addition, the segment provides information about the extended Microsoft platform through a variety of content offerings, such as Web-based training for developers and IT professionals. Through this segment, we offer a broad range of consulting services for advanced technology requirements, including custom solution services, enterprise application planning, architecture and design services, and proof-of-concept services. We also provide product support services to corporations and other large customers. The Server and Tools segment also includes: developer tools, training, and certification; Microsoft Press; the Enterprise and Partner Group, which is responsible for sales, partner management and partner programs for the enterprise business; and the Public Sector sales and marketing organization. \n\nProducts in Server and Tools provide a wide range of capabilities that include messaging and collaboration, database management, e-commerce, and mobile information access. These products are designed to work seamlessly with one another and with advancements in applications and development tools. This architecture is designed to help simplify the design, development, deployment, and management of solutions so that customers can focus less on integrating systems and training users, and more on adding strategic value to their businesses. Windows Server System also readily integrates with customers&#146; existing non-Microsoft systems, through support for open standards such as HTTP and XML, and through native support for XML-based Web services. \n\nWindows Server delivers a platform for powering connected applications, networks, and Web services from the work group to the data center. SQL Server is a database-and-analysis offering for rapidly delivering the next generation of scalable e-commerce, line-of-business, and data-warehousing solutions. Exchange Server, a business tool for e-mail collaboration, enables information workers to gain access to critical business communications. Systems Management Server (SMS) provides a comprehensive solution for change and configuration management of information systems, which we believe enables organizations to provide relevant software and updates to users quickly and cost-effectively. Small Business Server helps small businesses do more with a business server solution that includes messaging and collaboration, security-enhanced Internet access, protected data storage, reliable printing, the ability to run line-of-business applications, and faxing. BizTalk Server is designed to help customers efficiently and effectively integrate systems, employees, and trading partners through manageable business processes, enabling them to automate and orchestrate interactions in a flexible and highly automated manner. Developer tools focus on coordinating the overall programming model for the client and server, creating tools for developing Microsoft .NET-connected applications and services, and fostering synergies between Windows and the Windows Server System offerings. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker. The Information Worker segment is responsible for developing and delivering technologies that transform information into impact for people and organizations that create, analyze, communicate, and use information every day. The products in this segment help people to be more productive, with more control over their time and more opportunity to realize their potential. These applications are a critical part of the application architecture for many enterprises, enabling businesses to liberate information from individual silos, become more agile and flexible, and respond more readily to new opportunities. \n\nThe segment consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions. Microsoft Office System 2003, the successor to Microsoft Office XP, was released to market in the first half of fiscal 2004 and has evolved from a suite of personal productivity products to a more comprehensive and integrated system of products designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. The Microsoft Office System features integration with Microsoft intranet collaboration technologies, Information Rights Management, and support for industry standard XML. The Microsoft Office System includes the Microsoft Office 2003 Editions, which include (depending upon the edition): Microsoft Office Outlook 2003; Microsoft Office Excel 2003; Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003; Microsoft Office Word 2003; and Microsoft Office Access 2003. Other products in the Microsoft Office System include: Microsoft Office Visio 2003; Microsoft Office Project 2003; Microsoft Office Project Server 2003; Microsoft Office InfoPath 2003; Microsoft Office OneNote 2003; Microsoft Office Publisher 2003; Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003; and Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003. In addition, the Information Worker segment includes Microsoft Office Live Meeting Web conferencing service and professional product support. \n\nHistorically, approximately 40 percent of Information Worker billed revenue comes from multi-year license agreements with large enterprises. Revenues from these licenses generally depend upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise. Therefore, our revenue from this category of agreements is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year, but rather depends on the number of employees in a given enterprise. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 2 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nConsequently, general employment levels, particularly in North America and EMEA, significantly affect Information Worker revenue. Approximately 40 percent of Information Worker revenue comes from new licenses acquired through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs to individual consumers and enterprises of all sizes. Most of this revenue is sensitive to information technology budgets, which often depend on general economic conditions. The remaining approximately 20 percent of Information Worker revenue is from licenses to OEMs for new PCs and through sales of retail packaged products and is affected by the relative level of PC shipments. \n\nFor fiscal 2004, the segment includes the Small and Mid-Market Solutions &#38; Partners (SMS&#38;P) organization, which is responsible for sales, partner management, partner programs, and customer segment marketing to small and mid-market businesses. During fiscal 2004, we combined the existing small and medium business sales force with the sales and marketing assets of the Microsoft Business Solutions segment to form the SMS&#38;P organization. We announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a reorganization which, effective July 1, 2004, will include the SMS&#38;P organization in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. This change is designed to optimize our focus on delivering business applications to small and mid-market segment businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions. The Microsoft Business Solutions segment is responsible for developing and marketing integrated, end-to-end business applications and services designed to help small and mid-market businesses achieve success by becoming more connected with customers, employees, partners, and suppliers. The applications provide integrated, end-to-end automation for financial reporting, distribution, project accounting, electronic commerce, human resources and payroll, manufacturing, supply chain management, business intelligence, sales and marketing management, customer relationship management, and customer service and support. \n\nThe segment consists of the businesses generated from Enterprise Resource Planning (Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Solomon and Microsoft Axapta &#150; acquired through our purchase of Great Plains and Navision); Microsoft CRM (Customer Relationship Management); Microsoft RMS (Retail Management System); and other business applications and services. Microsoft Business Solutions products are sold, implemented, and supported through a partner network consisting of value-added resellers, systems integrators, consultants, independent software vendors (ISVs), accounting firms (national, regional, and local), application service providers (ASPs), and eBuilders. Microsoft Business Solutions partners provide distribution, marketing, training, and support in the business application customer segment. As described previously, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the SMS&#38;P organization, which was part of the Information Worker segment, will be included in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN. MSN is responsible for delivering online services that seek to empower people by bringing them closer to the people and information that matter most to them. MSN provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN manages many of its own properties, including health, autos, and shopping. MSN also creates alliances with leading third parties for many channels, including top partners like MSNBC.com, a joint venture between NBC Universal and Microsoft; Foxsports.com, a property of Fox Entertainment Group; Expedia.com and Match.com, operating units of InterActiveCorp and CareerBuilder.com. MSN provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment, including MSN Internet Access, Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, MSN Bill Pay, and MSN Radio Plus), and MSN Mobile services. \n\nThe segment generates revenue principally from advertisers on the MSN Web sites, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services, and from subscribers to MSN narrowband Internet access. According to studies performed by Nielson Net Ratings and comScore Media Metrix, MSN Web sites are among the most popular on the Internet, visited by more than 350 million unique users every month. MSN Hotmail is one of the world&#146;s largest e-mail services with more than 187 million accounts, and MSN Messenger is one of the world&#146;s largest instant-messaging services with more than 135 million accounts. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices. The Mobile and Embedded Devices segment is responsible for the development and marketing of products that extend the advantages of the Windows platform to many types of devices, including mobile devices that incorporate voice, personal information management, and media capabilities, and a wide variety of other devices designed to improve people&#146;s personal and work lives. Microsoft&#146;s vision for mobile devices is rooted in the convergence of the computing and wireless industries, which brings new opportunities to improve communication and information access for customers. We see software as a key differentiator in making smart devices and wireless data services valuable to customers through rich experiences such as location-based services, media, and speech recognition. We are working closely with mobile operators, hardware and ISV partners to \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 3 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\naccelerate the development and availability of smart devices and services, and to provide a broad range of choices for customers. Further, the segment is responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunications, cable and wireless companies, and host and network equipment providers. \n\nThe segment consists of the Windows Mobile software platform, the Windows Embedded device operating system family, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The Windows Mobile software platform provides a familiar and integrated customer experience that is the basis for specific products like the Pocket PC, Pocket PC Phone Edition, Smartphone, and new Portable Media Center. Windows Embedded, including Windows CE and Windows XP Embedded, is a family of embedded device software platforms used in non-PC computing devices. Windows Embedded software is used widely in advanced consumer electronics devices, including digital televisions, Internet Protocol (IP)-based set top boxes, network gateways, and portable media players, as well as in enterprise devices such as industrial controllers, retail point-of-sale systems, and voice-over-IP phones. The MapPoint family of location-enabled products and services includes the MapPoint Web Service, a hosted programmable XML Web service that allows developers to integrate location intelligence in applications, business processes and Web sites, and business and consumer oriented mapping CD-ROM products. Windows Automotive is an automotive-grade software platform that provides developers with the building blocks to quickly and reliably create a broad range of advanced telematics solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment. The Home and Entertainment segment is primarily responsible for realizing Microsoft&#146;s plans to grow a range of new consumer businesses, building on the Windows platform to offer a broad range of services and applications running on a wide variety of devices in the home. The Home and Entertainment segment is responsible for the development of and business strategy for the Microsoft Xbox video game system, including hardware, third-party games development, games development published under the Microsoft label, Xbox and Xbox Live operations, marketing, research, and sales and support. The segment leads the development efforts of our Home Products Division (HPD) product lines. It also carries out all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office, the Windows operating systems, Xbox, games, and HPD products. It is also responsible for the development, sales, and deployment of Microsoft&#146;s TV platform products for the interactive television industry. \n\nMicrosoft Xbox, released in fiscal 2002, is our video game console system that delivers high-quality graphics and audio experiences. We offer several types of entertainment products, including classic software games, online games, simulations, and strategy games. HPD includes Microsoft&#146;s line of consumer hardware and software products, such as the Encarta line of learning products and services, the Macintosh applications business, and Microsoft hardware products. \n\n&#160; \n\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have entered into joint venture arrangements to take advantage of creative talent and content from other organizations. The majority of our joint ventures are managed by the MSN segment. MSNBC Cable L.L.C., a 24-hour cable news and information channel and MSNBC Interactive News L.L.C., an interactive news service, both of which are owned 50% by us and 50% by National Broadcasting Company (NBC); ninemsn Pty Ltd, an Australian internet portal; and T1MSN, an internet portal serving Mexico are some of our joint venture arrangements. \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nWe develop products for sale throughout the world. Our major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the North American Region; the Latin American Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA); Japan; the Asia-Pacific Region; Greater China; and the worldwide OEM channel. To serve the needs of customers around the world, we &#147;localize&#148; many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions, and to improve the quality and usability of the product in international markets. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our research and development facilities are located primarily in Redmond, with smaller facilities located in Mountain View, California; Fargo, North Dakota; Beijing, China; Dublin, Ireland; Vedbaek, Denmark; Hyderabad, India; Haifa, Israel; and Cambridge, England. \n\nWe have regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and the greater Seattle area. The centers support all operations in their regions, including information processing and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Dublin, Ireland, supports the Europe, Middle East, and Africa region; the center in Singapore supports the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 4 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nJapan, Greater China and Asia-Pacific region; and the center in the greater Seattle area supports North America and Latin America. Microsoft Licensing, GP, a wholly-owned entity in Reno, Nevada, manages our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and certain organizational licensing operations and billing. \n\nWe contract most of our manufacturing activities to third parties. Outside manufacturers produce the Xbox, various retail software packaged products, and Microsoft hardware. Our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources. Key components that are currently obtained from a single source include the Xbox central processing unit (CPU) from Intel Corporation and the Xbox graphics processing unit (GPU) from NVIDIA Corporation. With the exception of the Xbox CPU and GPU, we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current manufacturing vendor becomes unavailable. We generally have multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components, and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. \n\nPressure to globalize our pricing structure might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the United States and other countries. A number of other factors could also have a negative effect on our business and results from operations outside of the United States, including changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region, including foreign exchange rates; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposures. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, research and development expense was $6.30 billion, $6.60 billion, and $7.78 billion respectively. Those amounts represented 22.2%, 20.5%, and 21.1%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years. Fiscal 2002 and 2003 have been restated to reflect the retroactive adoption of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . We plan to continue significant investment on a broad range of research and product development. \n\nMost of our software products are developed internally. We also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products. We believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products. Internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. Product documentation generally is also created internally. We strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness and Product Development Strategy. The key to Microsoft&#146;s growth is innovation. In fiscal 2004, we filed for more than 2,000 patents for new technologies, and we expect that number to increase. We expect these innovations to lead to revenue growth from market expansion, share growth, new scenarios and market opportunities, and value-added through services. \n\nKey areas of focus include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; PC Market Growth: It took more than 20 years to grow the worldwide base of PC users to 600+ million. By 2010, we expect this base to grow to 1 billion, due to opportunities in emerging markets and new scenarios and form factors expected to stimulate demand. Our continued success will depend on delivering secure, groundbreaking software and compelling scenarios that capture the imagination of end users. We are working on new PC and Windows designs to make PCs affordable to millions of additional people around the world. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; New Information Worker Scenarios: We believe one of our biggest growth opportunities is with our existing base of Office users. We plan to pursue this market by delivering new information worker scenarios such as collaboration, authoring, communications, planning and analysis, and expanding the toolset with new technologies such as SharePoint, Live Meeting, OneNote and InfoPath. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 5 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Enhanced Server Position: We believe Windows Server 2003 and our other server offerings provide customers with significant advantages in many areas, including innovation, performance, productivity, applications development tools and environment, security and manageability. In addition, we offer an integrated platform that includes our server and Information Worker applications as well as partner ISV workloads and applications. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Reducing Complexity and Cost for IT Professionals and Developers: We believe that building applications, integration, and managing information technology are still too hard for customers. We are working on new ways to further lower costs and speed time to deploy technology for IT professionals and developers. We believe we are already helping reduce costs and increase business value with products such as Windows Server 2003, Visual Studio .NET, SMS 2003, the Dynamic Systems Initiative, and Microsoft Operations Manager 2005. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; IT Services for Smaller Business and Consumers: The MSN, Windows, and Office teams are working together on a set of integrated IT services for smaller businesses and consumers designed to enhance security, lower costs, and improve the end-user experience in areas such as communication, collaboration, and desktop management. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Business Solutions: Microsoft Business Solutions continues to expand its small and mid-market offerings with key investments in technologies for CRM, online services, retail management, and small business. We believe we have a significant opportunity to help this underserved market, while creating great opportunities for ISVs and partners. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Non-PC Consumer Electronics: We believe that our work to integrate the richness and intelligence of the PC world with everyday devices such as mobile phones, handheld devices, home entertainment and TV provides a broad new market opportunity. At the center of our efforts are products such as Pocket PC and Smartphone, Portable Media Center, MSTV, MSN TV, Windows Automotive, the Windows Media Center Extender, and other electronic devices built on Windows CE and Windows XP Embedded. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Entertainment: Likewise, we believe there is significant opportunity in delivering compelling entertainment experiences in key scenarios such as music, TV, movies, photos and games. Our vision centers on creating new and exciting ways for people to have fun with friends and family with Media Center PCs, devices like Xbox and Portable Media Center, and many of the other applications and services that Microsoft and our partners deliver. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Advertising/Information: The value that MSN and our platform bring to advertisers is already significant, as evidenced by the fact that our MSN advertising business today is a $1 billion-plus business. We believe the potential to expand advertising in all our online offerings is significant. In fiscal 2005, we will invest in and deliver improvements in search, music and other information services that should continue to provide good growth opportunities. We believe our industry has only scratched the surface in search. We are making significant investments to improve the user experience and deliver the information people want more efficiently and effectively. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Communications: Broadband and wireless technology is increasing the amount of time people spend online. Younger and savvier Internet users want communications experiences to build their social network on any device. We believe professionals and information workers want integrated, secure functionality that help them manage their personal and professional lives: personalized email, instant messaging, contact management, shared calendars, and relationship management. We are pursuing these opportunities by developing communications offerings designed to provide the greatest benefit to consumers and device manufacturers. For example, our Windows Mobile software is the basis for new mobile smartphones and for Portable Media Center devices from leading consumer electronics companies. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES AND MARKETING \n\n&#160; \n\nWe distribute our products primarily through the following channels: OEM; distributors and resellers; and online services. Our six major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the North American Region; the Latin American Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region; Japan; the Asia-Pacific Region and Greater China. \n\n&#160; \n\nOEM. Our operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to build computing devices based on our operating systems, principally PCs. Under similar arrangements, we also market and license certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software products to OEMs. We have OEM agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 6 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nmajor PC OEMs, including Acer, Actebis, Dell, eMachines, Fujitsu, Gateway, HP, IBM, NEC, Samsung, Siemens Computers, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors operating in local markets. \n\n&#160; \n\nDistributors and Resellers. We distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Organizations license our products primarily through Large Account Resellers (LARs), Direct Market Resellers (DMRs), and value-added resellers. Many organizations that license products through Enterprise Agreements (EAs) now transact directly with us, with sales support from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. These Enterprise Software Advisors typically are also authorized as LARs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LARs are primarily engaged with large organizations and value-added resellers typically reach the breadth of small- and medium-sized organizations. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include Software Spectrum, Software House International, Dell, CDW, and Insight Enterprises. Individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets, including Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support. \n\nWe license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the end-user customer to acquire multiple licenses of product. These arrangements are designed to provide organizations with a means of acquiring multiple licenses, without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nOpen. Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations (5 to over 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (generally two years). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of software product over the contract period is called Software Assurance. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Under the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, or licenses with Software Assurance. They can also renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelect. Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations (greater than 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, Software Assurance, which consists of rights to future versions of software products, support, tools, and training over a specified time period (generally three years). Similar to the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Agreement. The Enterprise Agreement is targeted at medium and large organizations that want to acquire perpetual licenses to software products for all or substantial parts of their enterprise, along with rights to future versions of software products, generally over a three-year period. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Subscription Agreement. The Enterprise Subscription Agreement (ESA) is a time-based, multi-year licensing agreement. Under an ESA, customers acquire the right to use the current version of software products and the future versions that are released during the three-year term of the agreement. At the end of the term, customers may either renew their ESA or exercise a buy-out option to obtain perpetual licenses for the latest version of the covered products. If they do not elect one of these options, then all previously covered software must be uninstalled. \n\n&#160; \n\nOnline Services. We distribute online content and services through MSN and other online services. MSN delivers Internet access and other premium services and tools to consumers. MSN also delivers online e-mail and messaging communication services as well as information services such as online search and premium content. Microsoft Business Solutions operates the bCentral small-business portal, which is delivered online. The bCentral portal provides tools and expertise for small-business owners to build, market, and manage their businesses online. Other services delivered online include Xbox Live, Microsoft Developer Networks (MSDN) subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 7 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nCUSTOMERS \n\n&#160; \n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet Service Providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small and medium-sized organizations obtain our products primarily through resellers and OEMs. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10% of fiscal 2004 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2002 or 2003. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nCOMPETITION \n\n&#160; \n\nThe software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements, and changing business models in every segment. We face significant competition in all areas of our business. The rapid pace of technological change continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. Customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive, and as concerns such as security and privacy become more important. Our direct competitors include firms adopting alternative business models to the commercial software model. Firms adopting the non-commercial software model typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn revenue on complementary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Global software piracy &#150; the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products &#150; deprives us of significant amounts of revenue on an annual basis. Future versions of our products compete with the existing versions licensed to our installed base of customers. This means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product. \n\nOur competitive position may be adversely affected in the future by one or more of the factors described in this section, or as yet undefined additional factors that may arise. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient. Although we are the leader in PC operating system software products, we face strong competition from well-established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market. Competing commercial software products, including variants of Unix, are supplied by competitors such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and others, which are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. Personal computer OEMs who preinstall third-party operating systems may also license these firms&#146; operating systems. The Linux operating system, which is also derived from Unix and is available without payment under a General Public License, has gained increasing acceptance as competitive pressures lead personal computer OEMs to reduce costs. The Microsoft Windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms, as well as innovative devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers. We believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering better innovation, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, and the largest support network for any operating system. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools. Our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications, offered by firms with a variety of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and others offer their own variant of Unix preinstalled on server hardware, and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system. IBM&#146;s endorsement of Linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional Unix and Windows server operating systems. Linux&#146;s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers as well as non-commercial software developers. A number of companies supply versions of Linux, including Novell and Red Hat. \n\nWe compete in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions as well as middleware technology platforms. IBM and Sun Microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for the PC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, and Computer Associates. There are also a number of non-commercial software server applications available. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 8 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nNumerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, and e-business servers. Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with our collaboration and e-mail products. There are also a significant number of non-commercial software products that compete with our solutions, including Apache Web Server. \n\nOur developer products compete against offerings from BEA Systems, Borland, IBM, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and other companies. \n\nWe believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation, performance (both relative to total costs of ownership and in absolute terms), productivity, applications development tools and environment, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker. While we are the leader in business productivity software applications for personal computers, competitors to the Microsoft Office System include many software application vendors such as Apple, Corel, IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and local application developers in Europe and Asia. IBM and Corel have significant installed bases with their office productivity products, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, Apple and IBM preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with our applications. Corel&#146;s suite and Sun Microsystems&#146; Star Office are aggressively priced and attractive for OEMs to preinstall on low-priced PCs. The OpenOffice.org project provides a freely downloadable cross-platform application that is gaining popularity in certain market segments. In addition to traditional client-side applications, Web-based offerings such as SimDesk provide an alternative to Microsoft Office System products. In addition, IBM has a significant installed base of messaging and collaboration software. We believe that our products compete effectively by providing customers significant benefits, such as ease of use, personal productivity, support for effective teaming and collaboration, and better information management and control, and by providing many customers a lower total cost of ownership than alternatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions. The small and mid-market business applications segment is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors where we compete. We face competition from a large number of companies in this business. Well-known vendors focused on small and mid-market business solutions, such as Intuit and Sage (along with many others), compete against us for a portion of this segment. In addition, large-enterprise focused vendors, such as Oracle, PeopleSoft, and SAP, are repositioning some of their business applications to focus on small and medium-sized business and thus also compete against us for a portion of this segment. In addition, there are thousands of other vendors in specific localities or industries that offer their own enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and/or analytic solutions. We believe that our business applications products across financial management, supply chain management, and CRM compete effectively in our target segments by offering solutions and services that address multiple segment needs across industries through consistent innovation in product functionality delivered through a growing network of partners. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN. MSN competes with Yahoo!, Google, AOL, Earthlink, U.S. cable and DSL providers, and a vast array of Web sites and portals that offer content and online services of all types. MSN also competes with traditional advertising and print media. As the broadband access market grows, we expect to have increasing opportunities to deliver rich and compelling services and experiences for consumers. MSN&#146;s advertising revenue has grown considerably over the last year, and we expect this trend to continue in display advertising as well as in search-based advertising, as online advertising continues to gain market acceptance. This growth has led to competitors aggressively pursuing both advertisers and consumers with expanded offerings and new technology. We are building our own algorithmic search engine and investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business. Due to the continuing trend of consumers migrating from narrowband to broadband Internet access, we expect our narrowband Internet access subscriber base to decline. We believe our competitive advantage comes from our ability to empower people globally through information software and services that help them find, discover, and experience what they want online. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices. Windows Mobile software faces substantial competition from Nokia, Openwave Systems, PalmSource, QUALCOMM, and Symbian. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. Key competitors include IBM, Wind River, and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software. MapPoint competitors include DeLorme, MapInfo, Mapquest.com, Rand McNally, Webraska Mobile Technologies, and Yahoo! The telematics market is also highly fragmented, with competitive offerings from IBM and automotive suppliers building on various real-time \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 9 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1, 2 \n\n&#160; \n\noperating system platforms from commercial Linux vendors, QNX Software Systems, Wind River, and others. We believe that our products compete effectively by providing a familiar development framework that enables developers to easily write and deploy innovative applications for mobile or embedded devices; providing a flexible platform that allows customers and partners to build differentiated and profitable business models; and providing end users significant benefits such as ease of use, personal productivity, and better information management and control. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment. The home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles, frequent introductions of new products and titles, and the development of new technologies. The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition, and we anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors. These pressures have, from time to time, required us to reduce prices on certain products. Our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality and variety, timing of product releases, and effectiveness of distribution and marketing. \n\nOur Xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large established base of customers. In addition to competing against software published for non-Xbox platforms, our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by us to develop and publish software for the Xbox console. These competitors include Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, Electronic Arts, Sega, Take-Two Interactive, Tecmo, THQ, and Ubi Soft, among others. Success in the games business is increasingly driven by hit titles, which are difficult to develop and require substantial investments in development and marketing. In addition, other forms of entertainment such as music, motion pictures, and television compete against our entertainment software for consumer spending. We believe that our Xbox products compete effectively by providing customers benefits such as superior game console performance, exclusive game content, and innovative online multiplayer gaming through Xbox Live. Our PC hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners. \n\n&#160; \n\nEMPLOYEES \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of June 30, 2004, we employed approximately 57,000 people on a full-time basis, 37,000 in the United States and 20,000 internationally. Of the total, 24,000 were in product research and development, 16,000 in sales and marketing, 11,000 in product support and consulting services, 2,000 in manufacturing and distribution, and 4,000 in general and administration. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software industry. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit qualified employees, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be as successful in the future. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. \n\n&#160; \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com. There we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC. Our SEC reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of our Web site. The information found on our Web site is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. \n\n&#160; \n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES \n\n&#160; \n\nOur corporate offices consist of approximately 8.9 million square feet of office building space located in King County, Washington: 7.5 million square feet of that total is corporate campus space situated on slightly more than 300 acres of owned land and approximately 1.4 million square feet is leased. We are currently renovating two buildings with approximately 392,000 square feet that we plan to occupy in fiscal 2005. To accommodate future expansion needs we purchased approximately 63 acres, and have an option to purchase approximately 45 additional acres in Issaquah, Washington, which can accommodate 2.1 million square feet of additional office space. We own approximately 576,000 square feet of office building space domestically (outside of the Puget Sound corporate campus) and lease many sites domestically totaling approximately 2.8 million square feet of office building space. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 10 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 2, 3, 4 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe occupy many sites internationally, totaling approximately 6.1 million square feet that is leased and approximately 223,000 square feet that is owned. These facilities include our European Operations Center that leases a 187,000 square-foot campus in Dublin, Ireland, a 56,000 square-foot disk duplication facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico, and a 96,000 square-foot facility in Singapore for our Asia Pacific Operations Center and Regional headquarters. Leased office building space includes the following locations: Tokyo, Japan 459,000 square feet; Unterschleissheim, Germany 381,000 square feet; Les Ulis, France 261,000 square feet; Reading, England 241,000 square feet; and Mississauga, Canada 235,000 square feet. In addition to the above, we have various product development facilities, both domestically and internationally, as described in &#147;Operations&#148; above. \n\nOur facilities are fully used for current operations of all segments, and suitable additional space is available to accommodate expansion needs. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2002, 2003, AND 2004 \n\n&#160; \n\nManagement&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in &#147;Issues and Uncertainties&#148; and elsewhere in this report. \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (&#147;MD&#38;A&#148;) is intended to help the reader understand Microsoft Corporation. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes (&#147;Notes&#148;). \n\nWe generate revenues, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing, licensing, and supporting a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, personal computers (PCs), and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games and peripherals. Online communication services and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world. \n\nWe also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products. Delivering breakthrough innovation and high-value solutions through our integrated platform are the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. \n\nWe believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long-term growth, delivering innovative new products, creating opportunity for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, putting some of our most significant legal challenges behind us, and solidifying internal processes. Our focus in fiscal 2005 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, delivering compelling value propositions to customers, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. \n\nKey market opportunities include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Meeting the needs of a growing worldwide base of PC users, which we project will top 1 billion by 2010; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering new scenarios such as collaboration, authoring, communicating, planning, and analysis for information workers; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Continuing to compete against Linux and Unix for commercial workloads; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Reducing complexity and cost for IT professionals and developers; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering IT services for smaller business, and consumers; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Creating and delivering business solutions for small and mid-market segments; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Creating non-PC consumer electronics in areas such as mobile phones, handheld devices, home entertainment and TV; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering compelling entertainment experiences in areas such as music, TV, movies, photos, and games; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Expanding online advertising, and advances in search, music and other information services; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering integrated communications services for consumers and information workers. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nFor fiscal 2005, we believe industry-wide factors such as PC unit growth and the success of non-commercial software could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. PC unit growth was very strong in fiscal 2004, increasing approximately 13% from fiscal 2003. We do not expect similar growth to occur in fiscal 2005. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 15 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe believe that PC unit shipments will grow 7% to 9%, resulting in a forecasted fiscal 2005 Client revenue growth rate that we believe will be between 5% and 7%. \n\nWe continue to watch the evolution of open source software development and distribution, and continue to differentiate our products from competitive products including those based on open source software. We believe that Microsoft&#146;s share of server units grew modestly in fiscal 2004, while Linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis. The increase in Linux distributions reflects some significant public announcements of support and adoption of open source software in both the server and desktop markets in the last year. To the extent open source software products gain increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, which could result in a reduction in our revenue and operating margins. \n\nAdditionally, due primarily to our announced special dividend and quarterly dividend payments, if continued, we expect investment balances and resulting investment income to decrease significantly in fiscal 2005. \n\nWe have approximately $1.1 billion in original Upgrade Advantage contract value that will reach their expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. This revenue was recognized over the last two years and in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the contract period expires. \n\n&#160; \n\nSummary \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 28,365 &#160; $ 32,187 &#160; 13 % &#160; $ 36,835 &#160; 14 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 8,272 &#160; $ 9,545 &#160; 15 % &#160; $ 9,034 &#160; (5 )% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOur revenue growth for fiscal 2004 was driven by licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs; Windows Server operating systems, Office, and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments; and the continuing impact from multi-year licensing that occurred prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 program in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. We estimate growth in PC shipments was 13% during fiscal 2004, reflecting global economic improvement, which led to strength in the consumer segment in the first half of fiscal 2004 and to replacement PC and notebook sales in the enterprise segment in the second half of fiscal 2004. We estimate that total server hardware shipments grew 16%, with Windows Server shipments growing faster than the overall sector at 18% in fiscal 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal 2004, primarily due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. Had the rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2004, translated international revenue earned in local currencies would have been approximately $1.10 billion lower. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall translation exposure. Prior to the July 31, 2002 Licensing 6.0 transition date, we experienced a significant increase in multi-year licensing arrangements as customers enrolled in our maintenance programs, primarily Upgrade Advantage. Revenue growth in fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by multi-year licensing that occurred before the Licensing 6.0 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal 2003. The revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with OEM licensing of Microsoft Windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from Microsoft Xbox video game consoles. Revenue growth in fiscal 2002 was led by the addition of $1.35 billion of Xbox video game system revenue and $1.20 billion of revenue growth from Microsoft Windows XP Professional and Home operating systems. \n\nFor fiscal 2004, the operating income decline of $511 million was primarily caused by the $2.53 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and a fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating income was positively influenced by the revenue growth described above and operational improvements in our MSN business. In fiscal 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.82 billion in revenue, partially offset by an increase of $2.55 billion in operating expenses, primarily related to employee and related costs associated with additional headcount and increased legal settlement expenses, primarily the Time Warner settlement charge of $750 million. In fiscal 2002, the growth in operating income reflected an increase of $3.07 billion in revenue, substantially offset by an increase of $3.14 billion in operating expenses, which included the onset of costs related to Xbox video game systems. \n\nWe adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , on July 1, 2003 and restated prior periods to reflect compensation cost under the recognition provisions of SFAS 123 for \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 16 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nall awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Stock-based compensation expenses are included in operating expenses as part of headcount-related costs. Total stock-based compensation costs included in operating expenses were $5.73 billion in fiscal 2004, $3.75 billion in fiscal 2003, and $3.78 billion in fiscal 2002. \n\nIn fiscal 2005, we do not expect revenue to grow at similarly high rates as fiscal 2004, even if information technology spending continues to improve. While we expect general economic conditions to remain stable with the improvements seen in the second half of fiscal 2004, we expect PC and server unit shipment growth rates to decline in fiscal 2005 from the high growth rates in fiscal 2004. We estimate PC shipments will grow from 7% to 9% and Server unit shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. These lower growth rates may cause slower revenue growth in fiscal 2005. We are anticipating little or no year-over-year foreign exchange rate benefit in fiscal 2005. \n\nWe anticipate that we will renew between 10% and 30% of the expiring Upgrade Advantage program revenue through conversions to Software Assurance or migration to Enterprise Agreements. Total revenue expected to be recognized in our Information Worker, Server and Tools, and Client businesses from previously deferred Upgrade Advantage revenue is $56 million. \n\nMSN had a strong year in fiscal 2004 with revenue growth of 13% driven by over 40% growth in advertising revenue. In fiscal 2005, we expect MSN to see growth in advertising revenue and subscription and transaction revenue from premium Web services, partially offset by a reduction in access revenue as narrowband subscribers continue to decline. Accordingly, we do not expect the same level of revenue growth for MSN in fiscal 2005. \n\nHome and Entertainment revenue grew moderately in fiscal 2004. We do not expect significant growth in Home and Entertainment in fiscal 2005 as price reductions in the second half of fiscal 2004 related to the late stage of the Xbox lifecycle are expected to lead to lower revenue for the Xbox business. \n\nWe expect our operating income growth in fiscal 2005 to exceed our revenue growth. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to the absence of certain legal settlements which occurred in fiscal 2004, lower stock-based compensation costs, and benefits achieved through continued progress in our previously announced cost efficacy initiative. We expect that our segments in fiscal 2004 that reported a segment operating loss &#150; Mobile and Embedded Devices, Microsoft Business Solutions, and Home and Entertainment &#150; will make significant progress toward segment profitability in fiscal 2005 with improved operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nSEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) \n\n&#160; \n\nOur seven segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. \n\nThe revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts MD&#38;A are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP applied at the segment level. Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, IT, corporate development and procurement activities, research and development and other costs, and accrued legal contingencies. Corporate expenses were $3.08 billion, $3.74 billion and $4.66 billion in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 respectively. Segment information appearing in Note 18 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented in accordance with SFAS 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . \n\n&#160; \n\nThe tables that follow below for each segment present our segment revenue and operating income, determined on a basis consistent with U.S. GAAP: \n\n&#160; \n\nClient \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 9,360 &#160; $ 10,394 &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 11,546 &#160; 11 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 7,105 &#160; $ 8,017 &#160; 13 % &#160; $ 8,015 &#160; nm &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 17 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nClient includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Windows 2000 Professional, and other standard Windows operating systems. The growth of the Client segment&#146;s revenue is largely correlated with the growth of purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems. \n\nClient revenue increase was driven by a 14% growth in OEM licenses and 16% growth in OEM revenue on increased consumer PC unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business PC unit shipments in the second half of fiscal 2004. Revenue from commercial and retail licensing declined 4% due to lower revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and lower packaged product sales. In fiscal 2003, Client revenue growth was driven by OEM licensing revenue growth of $933 million and a 9 percentage point increase in the mix of the higher priced Windows Professional operating systems, the majority of which was in the OEM channel. Windows Professional revenue growth for fiscal 2003 was $1.59 billion, or 31%, compared to fiscal 2002. The Windows Professional growth in fiscal 2003 was partially offset by a $573 million decline in revenue from earlier versions of Windows operating systems. \n\nClient operating income was flat for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased operating expenses primarily related to the charge for the Sun Microsystems settlement of $700 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $307 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, offset by growth in revenue. Operating income for fiscal 2003 increased primarily as a result of the 11% growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, largely attributed to headcount additions and related costs. \n\nWe estimate that PC market growth will be from 7% to 9% in fiscal 2005. We expect emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates and we expect to hold our share in these respective markets. The differential market growth rate is expected to result in lower unit license growth in the OEM business and lower revenue growth, as piracy continues to be problematic in emerging markets, and significant price changes are not anticipated. We plan to continue our efforts to increase premium product mix but expect to see only modest improvements in fiscal 2005. The Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth. We expect operating profits as a percentage of Client revenue to improve in fiscal 2005, due to the legal settlements expenses and stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in fiscal 2004. Major investments in fiscal 2005 include development of the Windows Client next generation operating system (Longhorn), security programs, and marketing initiatives, including those related to Windows XP Service Pack 2 and other new products. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 6,157 &#160; $ 7,140 &#160; 16 % &#160; $ 8,483 &#160; 19 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 747 &#160; $ 1,121 &#160; 50 % &#160; $ 96 &#160; (91 )% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nServer and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and other servers. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier product support services, and Microsoft consulting services. Growth in the overall market for information technology, both hardware and software, is the principal driver for Server and Tools revenue growth. The segment concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. Products are sold through OEMs, distributors, direct to customers, and through one-time licenses or multi-year volume license agreements. \n\nWe estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 16% in fiscal 2004 compared to the prior year. Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.28 billion or 25% driven primarily by an estimated 18% increase in Windows-based server shipments resulting in 15% growth in new Windows Server licenses, and by favorable conversion of revenue billed in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue increased $189 million or 19% compared to fiscal 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, and Microsoft Press and other services declined $128 million or 14% compared to fiscal 2003 due to recognition of revenue deferred in prior years. Foreign exchange rates contributed approximately $350 million or 5% of Server and Tools revenue growth. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 18 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal Server and Tools revenue grew $983 million or 16% in fiscal 2003, driven by an increase in Windows-based server shipments and growth in SQL Server and Exchange revenue. Windows Server and CALs revenue grew $787 million or 18% from fiscal 2002 as a result of increased new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements. Consulting and Premier product support services increased $91 million or 10% compared to fiscal 2002. Revenue from developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, and other services increased $105 million or 13% from fiscal 2002. \n\nServer and Tools operating income for fiscal 2004 declined primarily due to the charge for the Sun Microsystems settlement of $1.22 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and $651 million of stock-based compensation costs from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Server and Tools operating income for fiscal 2003 grew 50%, primarily as a result of the 16% increase in revenue. \n\nWe anticipate that overall server hardware shipments will grow from 13% to 15% in fiscal 2005 and new licenses of Windows Server operating system will grow slightly faster than the overall market. We believe that Windows Server 2003 shipments will create opportunities for sales of Windows Server System products. However, we face strong competition from the Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. In addition, Server and Tools net revenue for fiscal 2005 will be unfavorably affected by the absence of revenue earned from our Upgrade Advantage program and no anticipated foreign exchange benefit. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 8,212 &#160; $ 9,229 &#160; 12 % &#160; $ 10,800 &#160; 17 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 5,932 &#160; $ 6,486 &#160; 9 % &#160; $ 7,151 &#160; 10 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInformation Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, SharePoint Portal Server CALs, other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting and OneNote, and professional product support services. Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other Information Worker areas such as document lifecycle and collaboration. \n\nRevenue growth for fiscal 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan was 15% in aggregate. This increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed prior to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 programs and approximately $110 million related to the launch of Office 2003. OEM licensing revenue grew 29% or $325 million. Foreign exchange rates provided approximately $485 million or 5% of total Information Worker revenue growth. The $1.02 billion or 12% increase in revenue in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to growth in Office suites revenue associated with new and anniversary multi-year licensing agreements and a $264 million or 28% increase in revenue from the combined total of Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, and other stand-alone applications. \n\nInformation Worker operating income in fiscal 2004 increased from the prior year primarily due to growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses. Information Worker operating profit for fiscal 2003 grew 9% compared to fiscal 2002, led by the 12% increase in revenue and partially offset by a 20% growth in operating expenses related to headcount additions and marketing expenses. \n\nFiscal 2005 Information Worker revenue is expected to be similar to fiscal 2004. We are expecting a reduction in revenue earned from our Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and no anticipated foreign exchange rate benefit. The significant reduction in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue is expected to be offset by sustained momentum in our OEM and multi-year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 19 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 308 &#160; &#160; $ 567 &#160; &#160; 84 % &#160; $ 667 &#160; &#160; 18 % Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (301 ) &#160; $ (309 ) &#160; 3 % &#160; $ (255 ) &#160; (17 )% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions includes Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Solomon, Microsoft CRM, MBN/Retail Manager and other business applications and services. Our revenue is generally derived from developing and marketing integrated, end-to-end business applications and services designed to help small and mid-market businesses. The small and mid-market business applications market is highly fragmented and is intensely competitive in all sectors. Microsoft Business Solutions revenues are affected by the general economic environment and enterprise information technology spending in particular. \n\nThe revenue increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta ERP products, and new sales of Microsoft CRM. Microsoft Business Solutions revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $259 million from fiscal 2002, of which $246 million was attributable to the acquisition of Navision at the beginning of the fiscal year. \n\nThe operating loss for fiscal 2004 declined from fiscal 2003 due to the increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including $42 million of lower amortization costs, partially offset by $27 million in stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Microsoft Business Solutions operating loss for fiscal 2003 increased from fiscal 2002 primarily due to operating losses associated with Navision, increases in sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses, and acquisition-related costs. \n\nWe announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 a plan to align and include the Small and Mid-Market Solutions &#38; Partners (SMS&#38;P) organization in the Microsoft Business Solutions segment. This change is designed to optimize our focus on delivering business applications to small and mid-market segment businesses. The SMS&#38;P organization is currently part of the Information Worker segment. This reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the Microsoft Business Solutions and Information Worker reported results, primarily from the reorganization of approximately $100 million in revenue and costs associated with our Partner program offerings, which will move from Information Worker segment to Microsoft Business Solutions. In fiscal 2005, we expect continued growth for Microsoft Business Solutions through CRM, Axapta, Navision, and Great Plains product lines with increased sales and marketing focus from the SMS&#38;P organization, and new product launches for Great Plains and Navision. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 1,571 &#160; &#160; $ 1,953 &#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; $ 2,216 &#160; 13 % Operating income/(loss) \n\n&#160; $ (909 ) &#160; $ (567 ) &#160; (38 )% &#160; $ 121 &#160; nm &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nThe MSN segment includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the World. MSN also provides a variety of paid services resulting in revenue for the segment including MSN Internet Access, and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is principally generated from advertisers on MSN, from consumers through subscriptions and transactions generated from MSN Premium Web Services and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. \n\nIn fiscal 2004, MSN advertising revenue increased $360 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. This increase was partially offset by a decline of $168 million or 15% in Internet access revenue, primarily from the migration of internet access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet access increased $71 million in fiscal 2004 to $95 million. At the end of the current fiscal year, MSN had 4.3 million internet access subscribers compared to 6.5 million at the end of the prior fiscal year and 8.8 million total subscribers compared to 8.6 million at the end of the prior year. In addition, MSN has over 350 million unique users \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 20 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nmonthly, 187 million active Hotmail accounts, and 135 million active Messenger accounts. Compared to fiscal 2002, MSN advertising revenue grew $270 million or 48% in fiscal 2003 as a result of growth in paid search and strong online advertising sales across all geographic regions. MSN subscription revenue grew $112 million or 11% in fiscal 2003 reflecting an increase in the number of paying non-promotion subscribers. \n\nMSN reached segment profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and was profitable for the full fiscal year. The improvement in profitability was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from advertising in both display and paid search, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet access business, efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses, and a $48 million refund of prior year taxes, partially offset by $144 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. MSN operating loss for fiscal 2003 decreased from fiscal 2002, primarily as a result of the growth in revenue and lower relative subscription acquisition and support costs. \n\nMSN expects advertising revenue and revenue from subscriptions and transactions for premium Web services to increase in fiscal 2005. Advertising revenue should benefit from expected increases in Internet spending and additions to the advertising platform including music download service, communication innovations, and an improved search engine. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet access to decline in fiscal 2005 as narrowband subscribers continue to migrate to broadband Internet access. We announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 an increase to the amount of storage we will provide for select MSN and Hotmail email accounts which will increase operating costs and may impact the revenues from our extra storage customers. However, we expect the segment to increase its profitability in fiscal 2005, led by continued operational efficiencies and lower unit margin costs in both the subscriber and advertising businesses. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 112 &#160; &#160; $ 156 &#160; &#160; 39 % &#160; $ 247 &#160; &#160; 58 % Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (275 ) &#160; $ (277 ) &#160; 1 % &#160; $ (224 ) &#160; (19 )% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile software, Windows Embedded device operating systems, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The segment&#146;s products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile phones and Pocket PCs. The segment is also responsible for managing sales and customer relations with device manufacturers and with network service providers, including telecommunications, cable and wireless companies, and host and network equipment providers. The embedded operating system market is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings and relatively short product life cycles that affect our continuing revenue streams. \n\nUnit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 in all product lines. The growth was primarily due to the increase in the number of OEMs and mobile operators shipping Windows Mobile software for SmartPhones, increases in market share for our Pocket PC and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our MapPoint Web Service. Revenue for fiscal 2003 grew $44 million driven by increased Pocket PC shipments and MapPoint licensing. \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices&#146; operating loss for fiscal 2004 decreased compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to growth in revenue and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by $58 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Operating loss for fiscal 2003 grew 1% from the prior year as higher marketing expenses and headcount-related costs associated with product development offset the growth in revenue. \n\nWe expect demand for mobile and embedded devices based on Windows Mobile software to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity as well as by an increase in the number of OEMs and mobile operators offering Windows-based devices. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 21 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage \n\ninc./ (dec.) \n\n&#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 2,453 &#160; &#160; $ 2,748 &#160; &#160; 12 % &#160; $ 2,876 &#160; &#160; 5 % Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (1,135 ) &#160; $ (1,191 ) &#160; 5 % &#160; $ (1,215 ) &#160; 2 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The relative success of competing video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the relative market share of the console. We are a relatively new entrant in the video game console businesses with our first release in fiscal 2002, and have established ourselves as one of the leaders. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since 2002, but revenue growth moderated in fiscal 2004 due to price reductions typical at this stage in the console lifecycle. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, providing higher margins to offset the decreasing price trend on consoles sold. \n\nIn fiscal 2004, Xbox revenue increased $144 million or 9% with $269 million related to higher Xbox software volumes and $117 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $242 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Overall, Xbox console volumes increased 11% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The Xbox life-to-date U.S. games attach rate increased to 6.9 games per console according to industry analyst NPD as of June 30, 2004. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $16 million or 1% compared to fiscal 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales, partially offset by the new release of Mac Office. The increase in Home and Entertainment revenue in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 was the result of sales of Xbox video game systems and related games which were available for all of fiscal 2003. Xbox revenue grew $309 million or 23% in fiscal 2003 reflecting a $779 million increase from higher volumes for Xbox consoles, games, and peripherals partially offset by a $470 million decrease due to price changes. Revenue from consumer hardware and software and PC games declined $14 million or 1% in fiscal 2003, driving the decrease in Home Products revenue. \n\nThe increase in operating loss in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $141 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, increased sales of negative margin consoles, and costs associated with the next generation console development efforts, partially offset by increased Xbox and Mac Office software sales. The operating loss increase from fiscal 2003 also included a lower of cost or market adjustment of approximately $90 million, reflecting the current stage in the lifecycle of the Xbox console. Operating loss in 2003 increased by $56 million or 5% from the prior year as the product costs associated with the increased Xbox console sales and increased marketing expense more than offset the 12% increase in revenue. \n\nIn fiscal 2005, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 consistent with this stage of the Xbox console lifecycle, partially offset by increased unit volumes driven by the launch of software titles such as Halo2. In fiscal 2005 we expect PC games revenue to decrease from fiscal 2004 driven by fewer new game titles. Other HPD revenue are expected to increase moderately as a result of the launch of the latest version of Mac Office late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2005, we expect operating margins to improve from fiscal 2004 driven by lower unit volumes of negative margin consoles and increased sales of high margin software. We expect development spending to be higher in fiscal 2005 driven by investment in the next generation Xbox platform design. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Cost of revenue \n\n&#160; $ 5,699 &#160; &#160; $ 6,059 &#160; &#160; 6 % &#160; $ 6,716 &#160; &#160; 11 % As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 20.1 % &#160; &#160; 18.8 % &#160; (1.3 )pp &#160; &#160; 18.2 % &#160; (0.6 )pp ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 22 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of $508 million, $214 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, and a lower of cost or market adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 by approximately $90 million, reflecting the current stage of the life cycle of the Xbox console, partially offset by $365 million decrease in MSN services costs. In fiscal 2003, the primary driver of the increase was a 4.4 percentage point increase from Home and Entertainment products and a 1.6 percentage point decrease from MSN product and service costs in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 6,299 &#160; &#160; $ 6,595 &#160; &#160; 5 % &#160; $ 7,779 &#160; &#160; 18 % As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 22.2 % &#160; &#160; 20.5 % &#160; (1.7 )pp &#160; &#160; 21.1 % &#160; 0.6 pp ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to $1.31 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 as well as other headcount-related payroll and other employee costs related to a 3% growth in research and development headcount from fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the increase reflects an increase in headcount-related costs, a 25% increase in third-party product development costs, and a 29% increase in testing laboratory equipment and expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; Sales and marketing \n\n&#160; $ 6,252 &#160; &#160; $ 7,562 &#160; &#160; 21 % &#160; $ 8,309 &#160; &#160; 10 % As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 22.0 % &#160; &#160; 23.5 % &#160; 1.5 pp &#160; &#160; 22.6 % &#160; (0.9 )pp ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. Sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal 2004 due to $400 million of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and other headcount-related costs related to a 9% growth in sales and marketing headcount. In fiscal 2003, the sales and marketing expense increase of $1.31 billion dollars was due to an increase in sales expenses related to headcount additions, principally related to the Enterprise and Small/Medium Business sales forces, and a 21% increase in marketing expenses. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percentage inc./ (dec.) &#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 1,843 &#160; &#160; $ 2,426 &#160; &#160; 32 % &#160; $ 4,997 &#160; &#160; 106 % As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 6.5 % &#160; &#160; 7.5 % &#160; 1.0 pp &#160; &#160; 13.6 % &#160; 6.1 pp ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 23 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, equity compensation and other headcount-related costs associated with the finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount, and legal costs and other administrative fees. General and administrative costs increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to legal expenses including $1.92 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement, a $605 million fine imposed by the European Commission in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, $280 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004, other legal costs of approximately $104 million, and other headcount related costs. General and administrative costs in fiscal 2003 increased $583 million from fiscal 2002 due to a charge of $750 million related to a settlement with Time Warner in the fourth quarter of 2003 and a $256 million charge reflecting an increase in our estimate of costs related to resolving pending antitrust and unfair competition consumer class action lawsuits. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment Income/(Loss), and Income Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment Income/(Loss) \n\n&#160; \n\nThe components of investment income/(loss) in each fiscal year are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) / Year Ended June 30 &#160; 2002 &#160; &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Dividends and interest \n\n&#160; $ 2,119 &#160; &#160; $ 1,957 &#160; &#160; $ 1,892 &#160; Net recognized gains (losses) on investments \n\n&#160; &#160; (1,807 ) &#160; &#160; 44 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,563 &#160; Net losses on derivatives \n\n&#160; &#160; (617 ) &#160; &#160; (424 ) &#160; &#160; (268 ) &#160; &#160; Investment income /(loss) \n\n&#160; $ (305 ) &#160; $ 1,577 &#160; &#160; $ 3,187 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDividends and interest income decreased $65 million in fiscal 2004 mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of AT&#38;T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of Comcast during fiscal 2003 and declining interest rates, partly offset by a larger investment portfolio. Net recognized gains (losses) on investments include other-than-temporary impairments of $82 million in fiscal 2004 compared to $1.15 billion in the prior year as well as higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. Net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal 2004 and $1.19 billion in fiscal 2003. The decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. Derivative losses decreased $156 million to $268 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities. \n\nIn fiscal 2003, dividends and interest income decreased $162 million driven primarily by a reduction in dividend income of $97 million resulting from the exchange of AT&#38;T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of Comcast during the second quarter of fiscal 2003, and declining interest rates partially offset by a larger investment portfolio. Net recognized gains (losses) on investments includes other-than-temporary impairments of $1.15 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $4.32 billion in fiscal 2002 and net realized gains on investments of $1.19 billion in fiscal 2003 compared to $2.52 billion in fiscal 2002. The decrease in other-than-temporary impairments in 2003 was also due to the reduced cost-basis of investments resulting from significant 2002 impairments of investments in the cable and telecommunications sectors. \n\nIn fiscal 2002, other-than-temporary impairments of $4.32 billion primarily related to our investment in AT&#38;T and other cable and telecommunication investments. Net realized gains on the sales of investments of $2.52 billion included a $1.25 billion gain on sale of our interest in Expedia. \n\nInvestments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 24 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nOur effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 33%. A benefit of $208 million was recorded during the fourth quarter from the reversal of previously accrued taxes from resolving the remaining open issue remanded by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in December 2002. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was approximately 27%. During the third quarter the tax rate increased due to the European Commission fine, which is not tax deductible. \n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 was 32% each year. The fiscal 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes related to the initial items from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling referred to above, that reversed, in part, a previous Tax Court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers. Excluding this reversal, the effective tax rate would have been 33%. \n\n&#160; \n\nStock-based Compensation. We implemented changes in fiscal 2004 in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees, and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders. Generally, employees are now granted stock awards instead of stock options. The stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn shares of our stock over time, rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 whereby employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher (&#147;eligible options&#148;) to JPMorgan Chase Bank (JPMorgan). The unvested eligible options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. The price paid by JPMorgan for the transferred options was determined by reference to the arithmetic average of the closing prices of Microsoft common stock during the period from November 14, 2003 to December 8, 2003, which was $25.5720. Note 13 &#150; Employee Stock and Savings Plan of the Notes to the Financial Statements provides additional information on employee stock and savings plans. \n\nIn addition, effective July 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , using the retroactive restatement method described in SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation &#150; Transition and Disclosure . Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. The June 30, 2003 balance sheet has been restated for the retroactive adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123, which resulted in a $13.89 billion increase in common stock and paid-in capital, a $10.00 billion decrease in retained earnings, and a $3.89 billion increase in deferred income taxes. \n\nGiven these changes the following table provides stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2002 through 2004 by segment. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except expense per share) (1) &#160; 2002 &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 Client \n\n&#160; $ 471 &#160; $ 450 &#160; $ 738 Server and Tools \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,301 &#160; &#160; 1,274 &#160; &#160; 1,862 Information Worker \n\n&#160; &#160; 516 &#160; &#160; 510 &#160; &#160; 848 Microsoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; &#160; 125 &#160; &#160; 129 &#160; &#160; 147 MSN \n\n&#160; &#160; 268 &#160; &#160; 262 &#160; &#160; 392 Mobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; &#160; 118 &#160; &#160; 129 &#160; &#160; 170 Home and Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 261 &#160; &#160; 257 &#160; &#160; 381 Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 724 &#160; &#160; 738 &#160; &#160; 1,196 &#160; &#160; Stock-based employee compensation expense \n\n&#160; $ 3,784 &#160; $ 3,749 &#160; $ 5,734 After-tax stock-based employee compensation expense \n\n&#160; $ 2,573 &#160; $ 2,512 &#160; $ 3,842 After-tax stock-based employee compensation expense per diluted share \n\n&#160; $ 0.23 &#160; $ 0.23 &#160; $ 0.35 ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; The amounts for fiscal 2004 include $2.21 billion ($1.48 billion after-tax or $0.14 per diluted share) due to the completion of the employee stock option transfer program. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 25 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION \n\n&#160; \n\nOur cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. Equity and other investments were $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency positions, in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. \n\nUnearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product&#146;s life cycle. The percentage of revenue recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements ranges from approximately 15% to 25% of the sales price for Windows XP Home, approximately 5% to 15% of the sales price for Windows XP Professional, and approximately 1% to 15% of the sales price for desktop applications, depending on the terms and conditions of the license and prices of the elements. Product life cycles are currently estimated at three-and-one-half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications. Unearned revenue also includes payments for online advertising for which the advertisement has yet to be displayed and payments for post-delivery support services to be performed in the future. \n\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2004 decreased $838 million from June 30, 2003, reflecting recognition of unearned revenue from multi-year licensing that has outpaced additions by $397 million, primarily due to recognition from Upgrade Advantage licensing agreements and a $489 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. Starting April 1, 2003 revenue deferred for undelivered elements reflected lower deferral rates, partially offset by lengthened product life cycles for the underlying products licensed, resulting in a higher proportion of revenue earned. We earned approximately $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion from the Upgrade Advantage programs for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively and expect to earn approximately $56 million in fiscal 2005 from those programs. \n\n&#160; \n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flow from operations for fiscal 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commission fine mentioned above partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase any common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2004. Cash used for investing was $2.75 billion in fiscal 2004, a decrease of $4.47 billion from fiscal 2003, due to a $3.63 billion decrease in net investment purchases and a $1.06 billion decrease in acquisition spending. \n\nCash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal 2002. The increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels. Cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal 2003, an increase of $651 million from the prior year. The increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417 million in common stock repurchase, offsetting $623 million received for common stock issued. We repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2003. Cash used for investing was $7.21 billion in fiscal 2003, a decrease of $3.63 billion from fiscal 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments. \n\nCash flow from operations was $14.51 billion for fiscal 2002, an increase of $1.09 billion from fiscal 2001. The increase reflected strong growth in unearned revenue as a result of the significant number of customers that purchased Upgrade Advantage during the Licensing 6.0 transition period. This resulted in an increase in billings and a corresponding increase in the unearned revenue amount. Cash used for financing was $4.57 billion in fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.01 billion from the prior year. The decrease reflected the repurchase of put warrants in the prior year. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 26 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe repurchased 245.6 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal 2002. In addition, 10.2 million shares of common stock were acquired in fiscal 2002 under a structured stock repurchase transaction. We entered into the structured stock repurchase transaction in fiscal 2001, which gave us the right to acquire 10.2 million of our shares in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million. Cash used for investing was $10.85 billion in fiscal 2002, an increase of $2.11 billion from fiscal 2001. \n\nWe have no material long-term debt. Stockholders&#146; equity at June 30, 2004 was $74.8 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $129 million on June 30, 2004. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling $318 million, $290 million, and $331 million in fiscal 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2004, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. \n\nOn July 20, 2004, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share payable on September 14, 2004, to shareholders of record on August 25, 2004. In addition, the board approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft Common stock over the next four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. The board also approved a one-time special dividend of $3.00 per share, or approximately $32 billion, subject to shareholder approval of stock plan amendments that will allow certain adjustments to employee equity compensation awards to offset the impact of the special dividend. The special dividend will be payable on December 2, 2004, to shareholders of record on November 17, 2004, conditioned upon shareholder approval of amendments to the employee stock plans at the annual meeting of shareholders scheduled to be held November 9, 2004. \n\nWe believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements and our special dividend as well as regular quarterly dividends. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, as well as equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company (Jupiter). These guarantees arose on February 1, 2003 in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements, including previous guarantees by us. The financing arrangements were entered into by Jupiter as part of financing its operations. As part of Jupiter&#146;s new financing agreement, we agreed to guarantee repayment by Jupiter of the loans of approximately $51 million. The estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was $11 million and did not result in a charge to operations. The guarantees are in effect until the earlier of either repayment of the loans, including accrued interest and fees, or February 1, 2009. The maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and any other related expenses. Additionally, the maximum amount of the guarantees, denominated in Japanese yen, will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If we were required to make payments under the guarantees, we might recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of Jupiter&#146;s assets. The proceeds from an asset liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the many factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 27 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FIN 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2004: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Payments due by period &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; 2006-2008 &#160; 2009-2011 &#160; 2012 and thereafter &#160; Total Long-term debt \n\n&#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; Construction commitments (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 127 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 129 Lease obligations: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Capital leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 7 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 34 Operating leases (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 141 &#160; &#160; 250 &#160; &#160; 86 &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; &#160; 501 Purchase commitments (4) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,340 &#160; &#160; 130 &#160; &#160; 90 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 1,560 Other long-term liabilities (5) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 204 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; 222 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total contractual obligations \n\n&#160; $ 1,615 &#160; $ 603 &#160; $ 200 &#160; $ 28 &#160; $ 2,446 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; We have excluded the recorded $1.04 billion contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in the third paragraph of Note 17 &#150; Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) &#160; We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings.

We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) &#160; We have excluded unearned revenue of $1.66 billion from other long-term liabilities presented above as these will not be settled in cash. We have also excluded the liability recorded for the Jupiter guarantee of $11 million. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\n&#160; \n\nIn December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation 46R (FIN 46R), a revision to Interpretation 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46R clarifies some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempts certain entities from its requirements. FIN 46R is effective at the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. Entities that have adopted FIN 46 prior to this effective date can continue to apply the provisions of FIN 46 until the effective date of FIN 46R or elect early adoption of FIN 46R. The adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46R did not have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn March 2004, the FASB ratified the recognition and measurement guidance and certain disclosure requirements for impaired securities as described in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The recognition and measurement guidance will be \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 28 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\napplied to other-than-temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning with our first fiscal quarter 2005. We do not believe the adoption of the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF Issue No. 03-1 will have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn July 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) consensus on Issue No. 02-14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock , which provides guidance regarding application of the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock. EITF Issue No. 02-14 will be effective beginning with our second quarter of fiscal 2005. We do not believe the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02-14 will have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes. \n\nWe account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product&#146;s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the ability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product&#146;s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. \n\nSFAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities, provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost; the financial health of and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such as industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability to hold the investment. Investments with an indicator are further evaluated to determine the likelihood of a significant adverse affect on the fair value and amount of the impairment as necessary. In the past, we have had substantial impairments in our portfolio as discussed in Note 4 &#150; Investment Income/(Loss). If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \n\nSFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nWe account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs, and SFAS 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 29 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nSoftware to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. SFAS 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. \n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. \n\nSFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES \n\n&#160; \n\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report, which, among others, should be considered in evaluating our future financial performance. \n\n&#160; \n\nChallenges to our Business Model. Since our inception, our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us. Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products. We believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. In recent years, there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model. Under the non-commercial software model, open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. The most notable example of open source software is the Linux operating system. While we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software, the popularization of the non-commercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. To the extent opens source software gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nIntellectual Property Rights. We defend our intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us. While this adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the United States is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 30 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nlicensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively, and revenue could be adversely affected by further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers. \n\nFrom time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow. Responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. If we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions, our operating margins may decline as a result. \n\nWe have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses of broad patent portfolios. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnauthorized Disclosure of Source Code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and software programs, is the most significant asset we own. While we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described below under &#147;Security&#148;. \n\n&#160; \n\nNew Products and Services. We have made significant investments in research, development and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including Longhorn, Microsoft .NET, Xbox, business applications, MSN, and mobile and wireless technologies. Significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, these products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. \n\n&#160; \n\nLitigation. As discussed in Note 17 &#150; Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the pending cases may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. While management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&#146;s view of these matters may change in the future. There exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurity. Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers. There are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. While this is an industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms, our customers in particular have been victims of such attacks and will likely continue to be so. We are devoting significant resources to addressing these critical issues. We are focusing our efforts on engineering more secure products, optimizing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products, and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment. In addition, we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released. We are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed. We are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools, our published security guidance, and the deployment of security software such as firewalls, antivirus, and other security software. These steps could adversely affect our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to purchase competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 31 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nDeclines in Demand for Software. If overall market demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Additionally, our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. A significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to Licensing 6.0 in July 2002. These agreements generally expired throughout fiscal 2004 and will largely be expired by the end of the first fiscal quarter in 2005. The rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenue. We are making significant investments in the next release of the Windows operating system, code-named Longhorn. If this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers, our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nProduct Development Schedule. The development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, particularly any delays in the Longhorn operating system, could adversely affect our revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral Economic and Geo-Political Risks. Softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue. Terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nCompetition. We continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. \n\n&#160; \n\nTaxation of Extraterritorial Income. In August 2001, a World Trade Organization (&#147;WTO&#148;) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act of 2000 (&#147;ETI&#148;) constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The U.S. government appealed the panel&#146;s decision and lost its appeal. On March 1, 2004, the European Union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on a specified list of U.S.-source goods. In May, the U.S. Senate passed the Jumpstart our Business Strength (JOBS) Act that would repeal ETI, provide a three-year phase-out of current ETI benefits, and would replace ETI with a phased-in 9% domestic production activity deduction that would not be fully effective until 2012. The U.S. House of Representatives passed similar legislation in June that would repeal ETI effective December 31, 2004, provide a two-year phase-out of ETI benefits, and replace ETI with a 3% tax rate reduction for income from domestic production activities that would be full phased in by 2006. Neither bill will fully replace our current ETI tax benefits. Both bills must still be reconciled in conference, and significant changes could be made to the final legislation, so we remain unable to assess the ultimate form and financial impact of this legislation, if enacted. If the ETI provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted, the loss of the ETI tax benefit to us could be significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Potential Tax Liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. \n\n&#160; \n\nInsurance Programs. In addition to conventional third-party insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2004, the face value of captive insurance arrangements was $2.0 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 32 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7, 7A \n\n&#160; \n\nbillion. Actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles, exclusions, other restrictions, and claims. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks, the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed in this document or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness Disruptions in the Event of a Catastrophic Event. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major earthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther. &#160; Other issues and uncertainties may include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; warranty and other claims for hardware products such as Xbox; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the effects of the Consent Decree in U.S. v. Microsoft and Final Judgment in State of New York v. Microsoft on the Windows operating system and server business, including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required by the Decree and Final Judgment and the ability of PC manufacturers to hide end-user access to certain new Windows features; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; currency fluctuations; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the continued availability of third-party distribution channels for MSN service and other online services; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; factors associated with our international operations, as described under Operations in Part I, Item 1 of this report; and ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments, such as the Comcast Corporation securities held by us that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n"}, "2005": {"item1": " ITEM 1. BUSINESS \n\n&#160; \n\nGENERAL \n\n&#160; \n\nOur mission is to enable people and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential. We work to achieve our mission through technology that transforms the way people work, play, and communicate. Since our founding in 1975, we have been a leader in this transformation. We develop and market software, services and solutions that deliver new opportunity, convenience, and value to people&#146;s lives. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT SEGMENTS \n\n&#160; \n\nOur product segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments provide a framework for the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and for the timely and rational allocation of development, sales, marketing, and services resources within businesses. The segments also help focus strategic planning efforts on key objectives and initiatives across our broad businesses. \n\nDue to our integrated business structure, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. Therefore, these segments are not designed to measure operating income or loss that is directly related to the products included in each segment. Inter-segment cost commissions are estimated by management and used to compensate or charge each segment for such shared costs and to motivate shared effort. Due to our integrated business structure, segments should not be viewed as discrete or easily separable businesses. \n\nOur seven product segments are: Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. See Note 18 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements for financial information regarding segment reporting. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient. The Microsoft Windows operating system integrates a wide range of applications, services and hardware in a familiar way, enabling people and organizations to use technology with ease and confidence. The Client segment has overall responsibility for product delivery, engineering, and technical architecture for the Windows product family, and our relationships with personal computer manufacturers, including multinational and regional original equipment manufacturer (OEM) accounts. The segment includes sales and marketing expenses for the Windows Client operating system and product development efforts for the Windows platform. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of purchases of personal computers (PCs) from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. \n\nThe Client segment includes Windows XP and other standard Windows operating systems. Windows XP extends the personal computing experience by uniting PCs, devices, and services, while enhancing reliability, security, and performance. With emerging form factors such as the Tablet PC and Media Center, and with investments in technology such as Windows Media, the Windows PC continues to evolve with innovations that enable people to use computers in more ways and in more places. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 3 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWindows XP Home Edition is designed for individuals or families and includes capabilities for digital photos, music, and video, home networking, and communications. Windows XP Professional, designed for business users and people who demand the most from their computing experience, includes all the features of Home Edition, along with advanced security, performance, manageability, and multilingual features to help customers improve their productivity and connectivity. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition meets the demands of specialized technical workstation users. Retail sales and marketing of pre-packaged units of Client products occurs through the Home and Entertainment segment. \n\nThe next generation of the Windows operating system, Windows Vista, is currently under development. This development phase represents a significant investment for the Client business and we expect that this will result in the most manageable and powerful operating system product ever released by Microsoft for both our business and consumer markets. While features and functions have not been finalized, Windows Vista will include significant advances in security, digital media, user interfaces, and other areas that are expected to enhance the user and developer experience. We are targeting broad availability of this operating system for the first half of fiscal year 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools. The Server and Tools segment develops and markets Windows Server System products, including Windows Server operating systems. Windows Server System is integrated server infrastructure software that is designed to support end-to-end software applications and tools built on the Windows Server 2003 operating system. In addition, the segment provides information to developers and information technology (IT) professionals about the extended Microsoft platform through a variety of content offerings, such as Web-based training. Through this segment, we offer a broad range of consulting services for advanced technology requirements, including custom solution services, enterprise application planning, architecture and design services, and proof-of-concept services. We also provide product support services to corporations and other large customers. The Server and Tools segment also includes: developer tools, training, and certification; Microsoft Press; the Enterprise and Partner Group, which is responsible for sales, partner management and partner programs for the enterprise business; and the Public Sector sales and marketing organization. \n\nProducts in Server and Tools provide a wide range of capabilities that include messaging and collaboration, database management, e-commerce, and mobile information access. These products are designed to work seamlessly with one another and with advances in applications and development tools. This architecture is designed to help simplify the design, development, deployment, and management of software applications and tools so that customers can focus less on integrating systems and training users, and more on adding strategic value to their businesses. Windows Server System also readily integrates with customers&#146; existing non-Microsoft systems, through support for open standards such as HTTP and XML, and through on-going support for XML-based Web services. \n\nWindows Server delivers a platform for powering connected applications, networks, and Web services from the work group to the data center. SQL Server is a relational database management system for rapidly delivering the next generation of scalable e-commerce, line-of-business, and data-warehousing solutions. Exchange Server, a business tool for e-mail collaboration and messaging, enables information workers to gain access to critical business communications. Systems Management Server (SMS) provides a comprehensive solution for change and configuration management of information systems that enables organizations to provide relevant software and updates to users quickly and cost-effectively. Small Business Server helps small businesses do more with a business server solution that includes messaging and collaboration, security-enhanced Internet access, protected data storage, reliable printing, the ability to run line-of-business applications, and faxing. BizTalk Server is designed to help customers efficiently and effectively integrate systems, employees, and trading partners through manageable business processes, enabling them to automate and orchestrate interactions in a flexible and highly automated manner. Developer tools focus on coordinating the overall programming model for the client and server and creating tools for developing Microsoft .NET-connected applications and services. During fiscal year 2006, Server and Tools plans to release major updates of several products, including new versions of SQL Server, Visual Studio and BizTalk Server, and the beta version of the next generation of Windows Server. \n\nServer and Tools uses multiple distribution channels including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year licenses depending upon the needs of different customer segments. Approximately 50% of Server revenue comes from multi-year licensing agreements, 40% is purchased through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs, and 10% comes from licenses sold to OEMs. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 4 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker. The Information Worker segment is responsible for developing and delivering software solutions that enable organizations to meet core objectives by empowering their people to transform information into impact. These solutions are an important part of an organization&#146;s application architecture, enabling them to respond more effectively to new opportunities and challenges through more effective use of their people and information. \n\nThe Information Worker segment has expanded its focus beyond personal productivity to look at how people interact with the flow of information in an organization. Doing so has provided the opportunity to deliver more value to small, medium, and large organizations and in home, student, and teacher segments through software and software-based services. \n\nThe most recent wave of Microsoft Office offerings, released to market in the first half of fiscal year 2004, represents an evolution from a suite of personal productivity products to a more comprehensive and integrated system of programs, servers, and services designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. The Microsoft Office system includes the Microsoft Office 2003 Editions, which include (depending upon the edition): Microsoft Office Outlook 2003; Microsoft Office Excel 2003; Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003; Microsoft Office Word 2003; Microsoft Office Access 2003; Microsoft Office InfoPath 2003; and Microsoft Office Publisher 2003. Other products in the Microsoft Office System include: Microsoft Office Visio 2003; Microsoft Office Project 2003; Microsoft Office Project Server 2003; Microsoft Office OneNote 2003; Microsoft Office FrontPage 2003; Microsoft Office Live Communications Server 2005; Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2005; Microsoft Office Communicator 2005; and Microsoft Office SharePoint Portal Server 2003. The Information Worker business also offers Virtual Office, an ad hoc, peer-to-peer collaboration solution. \n\nHistorically, approximately 40% of Information Worker billed revenue comes from multi-year license agreements with large enterprises. Revenues from these licenses generally depend upon the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise. Therefore, our revenue from this category of agreements is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year, but rather depends on the number of employees in a given enterprise. Consequently, general employment levels, particularly in North America and Europe, Middle East, and Africa, significantly affect Information Worker revenue. Approximately 40% of Information Worker revenue comes from new licenses acquired through fully packaged product and transactional volume licensing programs to individual consumers and enterprises of all sizes. Most of this revenue is sensitive to information technology budgets, which often depend on general economic conditions. The remaining approximately 20% of Information Worker revenue is from licenses to OEMs for new PCs and through sales of retail packaged products and is affected by the relative level of PC shipments. \n\nThe Information Worker segment releases most products in a &#147;wave&#148; approach, with a major release every 24-36 months. New products and investment areas will occasionally fall outside of the wave cycle. In fiscal year 2006, the Information Worker segment will release solutions outside of the next wave of products in business intelligence, small business accounting, and real time communications, while also preparing the sales team, partners, and customers for the next full wave of products, code named Office 12, due for release during the first half of fiscal year 2007. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions. The Microsoft Business Solutions segment is responsible for developing and marketing offerings to manage financial, customer relationship and supply chain management functions for small and midsize businesses, large organizations and divisions of global enterprises. Delivered through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services, these integrated, adaptable business solutions work like and with familiar Microsoft software to streamline processes across an entire business. Microsoft Business Solutions now includes the Small and Mid-Market Solutions &#38; Partners (SMS&#38;P) organization, which previously had been included in Information Worker. SMS&#38;P supports small and mid-market customers for all Microsoft products and services. \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions focuses on providing continuous innovation that integrates with solutions across Microsoft Office, Windows Server System and other Microsoft tools and technologies, and that provides rich functionality with high adaptability at lower costs. The solutions are designed to be easy to use and empower people to be more productive.

The Business Solutions R&#38;D team also develops Office Small Business Accounting and Business Contact Manager for Outlook, which are marketed by Information Worker. \n\nIn fiscal year 2006, Microsoft Business Solutions will release upgrades and/or updates to its core line of business solutions including releases for Microsoft CRM, Microsoft Axapta, Microsoft Great Plains, Microsoft Navision and Microsoft Solomon. These releases will focus on user experience, web services, contextual business intelligence, and portals that interoperate with other Microsoft technologies. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN. MSN is responsible for delivering online services that seek to empower users by bringing them closer to the people and information that matter most to them. MSN provides personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and information services such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN manages many of its own properties, including health, autos, and shopping. MSN also creates alliances with leading third parties for many channels, including top partners like MSNBC.com, a joint venture between NBC Universal and Microsoft; Foxsports.com, a property of Fox Entertainment Group; Expedia.com; Match.com, an operating unit of InterActiveCorp; and CareerBuilder.com. MSN provides a variety of paid solutions including MSN Internet Access, Premium Web Services (consisting of MSN Internet Software Subscription, MSN Hotmail Plus, MSN Bill Pay, and MSN Radio Plus), and MSN Mobile services. \n\nThe segment generates revenue primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners, through subscriptions and transactions, and from subscribers to MSN narrowband Internet access. According to studies performed by Nielsen Net Ratings and comScore Media Metrix, MSN Web sites are among the most popular on the Internet, visited by more than 420 million unique users every month. MSN Hotmail is one of the world&#146;s largest e-mail services with more than 205 million accounts, and MSN Messenger is one of the world&#146;s largest instant-messaging services with more than 175 million accounts. MSN also provides a variety of paid solutions including MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices. The Mobile and Embedded Devices segment is responsible for the development and marketing of products that extend the advantages of the Windows platform to many types of devices, including mobile devices that incorporate voice, personal information management, and media capabilities, and a wide variety of other devices designed to improve people&#146;s personal and work lives. Microsoft&#146;s vision for mobile devices is rooted in the convergence of the computing and wireless industries, which brings new opportunities to improve communication and information access for customers. We see software as a key differentiator in making smart devices and wireless data services valuable to customers through rich experiences such as mobile messaging, location-based services, media, and speech recognition. We are working closely with mobile operators, and hardware and software partners to accelerate the development and availability of smart devices and services, and to provide a broad range of choices for customers. The segment is also responsible for managing our company-wide sales and customer relations with mobile device manufacturers, and with host and network equipment and service providers, including telecommunications and cable and wireless companies. \n\nThe segment consists of the Windows Mobile software platform, the Windows Embedded device operating system family, MapPoint, and Windows Automotive. The Windows Mobile software platform provides a familiar and integrated customer experience that is the basis for specific devices like the Pocket PC, Pocket PC Phone Edition, Smartphone, and Portable Media Center. Windows Embedded, including Windows CE, Windows XP Embedded, and Windows XP Embedded for Point of Service, is a family of embedded device software platforms used in non-PC computing devices. Windows Embedded software is used widely in advanced consumer electronics devices, including digital televisions, Internet Protocol (IP)-based set top boxes, network gateways, and portable media players, and in enterprise devices such as industrial controllers, retail point-of-sale systems, and voice-over-IP phones. The MapPoint family of location-enabled products and services includes the MapPoint Web Service, a hosted programmable XML Web service that allows developers to integrate location intelligence in applications, business processes and Web sites, and business and consumer oriented mapping CD-ROM products. Windows Automotive is an automotive-grade software platform that provides developers with the building blocks to quickly and reliably create a broad range of advanced telematics solutions for vehicles. In fiscal year 2006, Mobile and Embedded Devices expects to release added functionality to the Windows Mobile 5.0 platform through the Microsoft Enterprise Feature Pack and the Exchange Service Pack 2. \n\nEffective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. This reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN reported results. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 6 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment. The Home and Entertainment segment is responsible for development, production, and marketing for the Xbox video game system, including hardware, third-party games, games published under the Microsoft label, Xbox and Xbox Live operations, marketing, research, and sales and support. The segment also leads the development efforts of our Home Products Division (HPD) product lines. In addition. it carries out all retail sales and marketing for Microsoft Office (for which it receives an inter-segment commission), the Windows operating systems, Xbox, PC games, and HPD products. It is also responsible for the development, sales, and deployment of Microsoft&#146;s TV platform products for the interactive television industry. \n\nMicrosoft Xbox, released in fiscal year 2002, is a video game console system that delivers high-quality graphics and audio experiences. Xbox 360, unveiled in May 2005, is our next-generation video game and entertainment system that we expect to be available in the first half of fiscal year 2006 in Europe, Japan and North America. In addition to Xbox, we offer several types of entertainment products, including PC software games, online games, and console games. HPD includes Microsoft&#146;s line of consumer software and hardware products, such as the Encarta line of learning products and services, application software for Macintosh computers, the Works productivity suite, and Microsoft PC hardware products such as mice, keyboards, and game controllers. The MSTV group develops the MSTV Foundation Edition and Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) products. \n\n&#160; \n\nOPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nTo serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we &#147;localize&#148; many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our research and development facilities are located primarily in Redmond, Washington with smaller facilities located in Mountain View, California; Fargo, North Dakota; Beijing, China; Dublin, Ireland; Vedbaek, Denmark; Hyderabad, India; Haifa, Israel; and Cambridge, England. \n\nWe have regional operations centers in Ireland; Singapore; Reno, Nevada; Fargo, North Dakota; and Redmond. The centers support all operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Dublin, Ireland, supports the EMEA region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, Greater China and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Reno, Fargo, and Redmond support North America and Latin America. \n\nWe contract most of our manufacturing activities to third parties. Outside manufacturers produce the Xbox, various retail software packaged products, and Microsoft hardware. Our products may include some components that are available from only one or limited sources. Key components that are currently obtained from a single source include the Xbox central processing unit (CPU) from Intel Corporation and the Xbox graphics processing unit (GPU) from NVIDIA Corporation. Similarly, our upcoming Xbox 360 console will also include certain key components that will be supplied at least initially by a single source: the CPU which will be purchased from IBM Corporation and the graphics chips and embedded DRAM chips for the GPU which will be purchased from TSMC and NEC, respectively. Though we have chosen to initially source these key Xbox 360 components from a single supplier, we are under no obligation to exclusively source components from these vendors in the future. Beyond the exceptions noted, we generally have the ability to use other custom manufacturers if the current vendor becomes unavailable. We generally have multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components, and are often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT \n\n&#160; \n\nDuring fiscal years 2003, 2004, and 2005, research and development expense was $6.60 billion, $7.78 billion, and $6.18 billion respectively. Those amounts represented 20.5%, 21.1%, and 15.5%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years. We plan to continue significant investment in a broad range of research and product development. \n\nMost of our software products are developed internally. We also purchase technology, license intellectual property rights, and oversee third-party development and localization of certain products. We believe we are not materially dependent upon licenses and other agreements with third parties relating to the development of our products. Internal development allows us to maintain closer technical control over our products. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. Product documentation generally is also created internally. We strive to obtain information at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. Before releasing new software platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 7 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nBusiness and Product Development Strategy. A key factor affecting Microsoft&#146;s growth is innovation. In fiscal year 2005, we filed for more than 3,000 U.S. patents for new technologies. We continue our long-term commitment to research and development, including advanced work aimed at important innovations in a wide spectrum of technologies: tools and platform; communication, collaboration and expression; information access and organization; entertainment; business and e-commerce; and devices. Through innovations in these areas, we expect to grow revenue via three principal strategies: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Growing our anchor businesses. The markets for our Client, Server &#38; Tools, and Information Worker businesses are continuing to grow as a result of growth in hardware shipments and software upgrades. We believe the growth in our anchor businesses can be accelerated by our forthcoming innovations, including the Windows Vista operating system, the Office 12 upgrade of the Microsoft Office system, and new products from our Server &#38; Tools business. In addition, we see opportunities to grow these businesses by making inroads against software piracy. As the world&#146;s emerging economies develop and integrate more fully into the global economy, we expect that intellectual property will be more widely and effectively protected, and the current widespread use of unlicensed software will gradually diminish. At the same time, we are developing new products and services that are specifically designed to appeal to the unique requirements of emerging markets. Among them are products designed to be readily available and affordable for first-time PC users. We also expect our anchor businesses to grow through successfully competing against alternative solutions. In servers, for example, we expect to continue gaining customers as a result of migration from UNIX. We particularly see opportunities in the markets for Web servers, data centers, e-mail servers and in high-performance computing. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Expanding our innovation portfolio. Across each of our businesses, we see opportunities for growth through expansion of the technologies we offer. Within our anchor businesses, we are working to develop new technologies that offer greater value in meeting many targeted customer needs: workflow management, real-time communications, document management, collaboration, terminal services, search and portals, unified messaging, media technologies management, anti-spam and anti-malware protection, network edge security, desktop access to enterprise applications, business intelligence, rights management services, and storage. We expect to offer these technologies as new products and also as higher-value versions of existing products. In our emerging businesses, we are also moving forward with a broad portfolio of products, with a goal of providing best-in-class products in every major market where we compete, such as gaming, software for mobile devices, small business applications and interactive television. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering software services. During the past several years, we have gained extensive experience in providing a variety of online consumer services, many of them supported by advertising or subscriptions. These services include the world&#146;s largest email service, one of the world&#146;s most popular online portals, MSN Search for the Web and the PC desktop, and Xbox Live, the world&#146;s largest online gaming service. We also have begun to develop services for business, such as Outlook Live and Office Live Meeting, which enable workers to collaborate interactively without the cost and disruption of business travel. We expect to pursue opportunities to offer other new services both to consumers and businesses. Our announced plans to acquire FrontBridge Technologies, for example, will enable us to provide businesses with e-mail filtering and security to help protect the health of their networks and the security of their data. We expect that services will be an important component of our future growth. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDISTRIBUTION, SALES AND MARKETING \n\n&#160; \n\nWe distribute our products primarily through the following channels: OEM; distributors and resellers; and online services. Our six major geographic sales and marketing organizations are the North American Region; the Latin American Region; the Europe, Middle East, and Africa Region (EMEA); Japan; the Asia-Pacific Region; and Greater China. \n\n&#160; \n\nOEM. Our operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to build computing devices based on our operating systems, principally PCs. Under similar arrangements, we also market and license certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and consumer software products to OEMs. We have OEM agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including Acer, Dell, Fujitsu, Fujitsu Siemens Computers, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, NEC, Samsung, Sony, and Toshiba. A substantial amount of OEM business is also conducted with system builders, which are low-volume customized PC vendors operating in local markets. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 8 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nDistributors and Resellers. We license software to organizations under arrangements that allow the end-user customer to acquire multiple licenses of products. Organizations license our products primarily through large account resellers (LARs), direct market resellers, and value-added resellers. Many organizations that license products through enterprise agreements (EAs) now transact directly with us, with sales support from our Enterprise Software Advisor channel partners. These Enterprise Software Advisors typically are also authorized as LARs and operate as resellers for our other licensing programs. Although each type of reselling partner reaches organizations of all sizes, LARs are primarily engaged with large organizations and value-added resellers typically reach the breadth of small- and medium-sized organizations. Some of our distributors include Ingram Micro and Tech Data, and some of our largest resellers include Software Spectrum, Software House International, Dell, CDW, and Insight Enterprises. Our business solutions software offerings are licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. We distribute our finished goods products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain our products primarily through retail outlets, including Best Buy, Wal-Mart, and Target. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicits orders from distributors and resellers and provides product training and sales support. \n\nOur arrangements for organizations to acquire multiple licenses of products are designed to provide them with a means of doing so without having to acquire separate packaged product through retail channels. In delivering organizational licensing arrangements to the market, we use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\nOpen. Designed primarily for small-to-medium organizations (5 to over 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, rights to future versions of software products over a specified time period (generally two years). The offering that conveys rights to future versions of certain software product over the contract period is called Software Assurance. Software Assurance also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. Under the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, or licenses with Software Assurance. They can also renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nSelect. Designed primarily for medium-to-large organizations (greater than 250 licenses), this program allows customers to acquire perpetual licenses and, at the customer&#146;s election, Software Assurance, which consists of rights to future versions of certain software products, support, tools, and training over a specified time period (generally three years). Similar to the Open program, customers can acquire licenses only, acquire licenses with Software Assurance, or renew Software Assurance upon the expiration of existing volume licensing agreements. \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Agreement. The Enterprise Agreement is targeted at medium and large organizations that want to acquire perpetual licenses to software products for all or substantial parts of their enterprise, along with rights to future versions of software products, support, tools, and training over a specified time period (generally three years). \n\n&#160; \n\nEnterprise Subscription Agreement. The Enterprise Subscription Agreement (ESA) is a time-based, multi-year licensing agreement. Under an ESA, customers acquire the right to use the current version of software products and the future versions that are released during the three-year term of the agreement. At the end of the term, customers may either renew their ESA or exercise a buy-out option to obtain perpetual licenses for the latest version of the covered products. If they do not elect one of these options, then all previously covered software must be uninstalled. \n\n&#160; \n\nOnline Services. We distribute online content and services through MSN and other online services. MSN delivers Internet access and various premium services and tools to consumers. MSN also delivers online e-mail and messaging communication services and information services such as online search and premium content. Home and Entertainment operates the Xbox Live service which allows customers to participate in the gaming experience with other subscribers online. Microsoft Business Solutions operates the Microsoft Small Business Center portal, which is delivered online. This portal provides tools and expertise for small-business owners to build, market, and manage their businesses online. Other services delivered online include Microsoft Developer Networks (MSDN) subscription content and updates, periodic product updates, and online technical and practice readiness resources to support our partners in developing and selling our products and solutions. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 9 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCUSTOMERS \n\n&#160; \n\nOur customers include individual consumers, small and medium-sized organizations, enterprises, governmental institutions, educational institutions, Internet Service Providers, application developers, and OEMs. Consumers and small- and medium-sized organizations obtain our products primarily through resellers and OEMs. Sales to Dell and its subsidiaries in the aggregate accounted for approximately 10% of fiscal year 2004 and 2005 revenue. These sales were made primarily through our OEM and volume licensing channels and cover a broad array of products including Windows PC operating systems, Microsoft Office, and server products. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue in 2003. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. \n\n&#160; \n\nCOMPETITION \n\n&#160; \n\nEvery segment of the software business is competitive and subject to rapid technological change, evolving customer requirements, and changing business models. We face significant competition in all areas of our business and intense competition in many of them. Because technology advances rapidly, competitors can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. Customer requirements and preferences continually change as other information technologies emerge or become less expensive, and as concerns such as security and privacy become more important. \n\nOur direct competitors include firms that have adopted the non-commercial software model. These firms typically provide customers with open source software at nominal cost and earn their revenue on complementary services and products. This approach allows these firms to compete without having to bear the full costs of software research and development. \n\nIn a sense, we also compete with pirated copies of our own software. Global software piracy &#150; the unlawful copying and distribution of our copyrighted software products &#150; deprives us of significant amounts of revenue on an annual basis. In addition, future versions of our products compete with the existing versions, which our licensed customers may choose to continue to use indefinitely. This means that future versions must deliver significant additional value in order to induce existing customers to purchase a new version of our product. \n\nOur competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of the factors described in this section, or as yet unidentified additional factors that may arise. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient. Although we are the leader in PC operating system software products, we face strong competition from well-established companies and entities with differing approaches to the market. Competing commercial software products, including variants of Unix, are supplied by competitors such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Sun Microsystems and others, which are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on their own computers. Personal computer OEMs who preinstall third-party operating systems may also license these firms&#146; operating systems. The Linux operating system, which is also derived from Unix and is available without payment under a General Public License, has gained increasing acceptance as competitive pressures lead personal computer OEMs to reduce costs. The Microsoft Windows operating systems also face competition from alternative platforms and new devices that may reduce consumer demand for traditional personal computers. Competitors such as Mozilla offer software that competes with the Internet Explorer Web browsing capabilities of our Windows operating system products. Apple Computer, Real Networks, and many others compete with the media playback capabilities (Windows Media Player) of our Windows operating system products. We believe current and future versions of these and other aspects of Windows will continue to compete effectively with non-Microsoft browsers, media players, and other non-Microsoft programs on important attributes such as features, functionality, and security. We believe our operating system products compete effectively by delivering innovative software, an easy-to-use interface, compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, and the largest support network for any operating system. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools. Our server operating system products face intense competition from a wide variety of competing server operating systems and server applications, offered by firms with a variety of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and others offer their own variant of Unix preinstalled on server hardware, and nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system. IBM&#146;s endorsement of Linux has accelerated its acceptance as an alternative to both traditional Unix and Windows server operating systems. Linux&#146;s competitive position has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many leading commercial software developers and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies supply versions of Linux, including Novell and Red Hat. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 10 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nWe compete in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing solutions with several companies that provide competing solutions and middleware technology platforms. IBM and Sun Microsystems lead a group of companies focused on the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Commercial software developers that provide competing server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, and Computer Associates. \n\nNumerous commercial software vendors offer competing commercial software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, and e-business servers. In addition, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with our collaboration and e-mail products. There are also a significant number of non-commercial software products that compete with our solutions, including the widely-deployed Apache Web Server. \n\nOur products for software developers compete against offerings from BEA Systems, Borland, IBM, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, and other companies. \n\nWe believe that our server products provide customers with significant advantages in innovation, performance, total costs of ownership, productivity, applications development tools and environment, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker. While we are the leader in business and personal productivity software applications for personal computers, competitors to the Microsoft Office System include many software application vendors such as Apple, Corel, IBM, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Novell, Red Hat, and local application developers in Europe and Asia. IBM (Smartsuite) and Corel (WordPerfect Suite) have significant installed bases with their office productivity products. Apple may preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with our applications. The OpenOffice.org project provides a freely downloadable cross-platform application that also has been adapted by various commercial software vendors (Sun, Novell, Red Hat, IBM, and others) to sell under their brand. Corel&#146;s suite, and many different local software suites around the world are aggressively priced for OEMs to preinstall on low-priced PCs. In addition to traditional client-side applications, Web-based offerings such as SimDesk can also provide an alternative to Microsoft Office System products. \n\nFurther, as customers have increasingly demanded additional functionality and products, including new server and service offerings, additional vendors are competing in the Information Worker segment, most notably in document management, collaboration tools, real time messaging and business intelligence. As just one example, Microsoft competes with IBM broadly in messaging and collaboration with our approach that spans multiple Information Worker products. We believe that our products compete effectively through ease of use, improving users&#146; personal productivity, providing tools for effective teaming and collaboration, better information management and control, and for many customers, a lower total cost of ownership than alternatives. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions. The products of Microsoft Business Solutions are targeted at small and midsized businesses (SMB) and larger organizations and divisions of global enterprises. The SMB segment for business solutions is highly fragmented with many companies in this business. Well-known vendors focused on providing solutions for small and midsized businesses, such as Intuit and Sage, compete against us for a portion of this segment. The segment consisting of large organizations and divisions of global enterprises continues to be intensely competitive with a small number of primary vendors providing products and services such as SAP, Oracle/Peoplesoft and Siebel. In addition these large enterprise-focused vendors are repositioning some of their business applications to focus on the SMB segment, and divisions of global enterprises, and thus also compete against us for a portion of the market opportunity. Our business solution products also compete with hosted solutions offered by companies such as Salesforce.com. In addition, there are thousands of other vendors in specific localities or industries that offer their own solutions. We believe that our business solutions across financial management, supply chain management, and customer relationship management (CRM) compete effectively in our target segments by offering integrated solutions that address multiple segment needs across industries and vertical markets through consistent innovation that are delivered through a growing network of partners and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN. MSN competes with Yahoo!, Google, AOL, and a vast array of Web sites and portals that offer content and online services of all types to end users, and we compete with these organizations to provide advertising opportunities for merchants to reach their audiences. MSN also competes for narrowband internet access users with Earthlink, AOL and other ISPs for dial-up internet access in the United States. The global online advertising market has grown significantly over the past several years, and we anticipate this trend to continue especially in display and \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 11 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nin search-based advertising. As a result competitors are aggressively developing internet services that provide enhanced functionality for end users in communication services, improvements in information services such as internet search, and advertising infrastructure and support services including more effective ways of connecting advertisers with audiences. We have built our own algorithmic search engine to provide end users with more relevant search results, broader selection of content, and expanded set of search services, and we are investing to support the continued growth of our advertising business. We are also investing in our communication services, and our technology, operations, and sales efforts to support the continued growth of our advertising business. We will continue to introduce new products and services aimed at attracting additional users by improving the user experience in an effort to increase our satisfaction levels with our end users and merchant customers. Due to the continuing trend of consumers migrating from narrowband to broadband Internet access, we expect our narrowband Internet access subscriber base to continue to decline. We believe that we can compete effectively across the breadth of our internet services by providing users with software innovation in the form of information and communication services that help them find, discover, and experience what they want online and by providing merchants with effective advertising results through improved systems and sales support. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices. Windows Mobile software faces substantial competition from Nokia, Openwave Systems, PalmSource, QUALCOMM, and Symbian. The embedded operating system segment is highly fragmented with many competitive offerings. Key competitors include IBM, Wind River, and versions of embeddable Linux from commercial Linux vendors such as Metrowerks and MontaVista Software. MapPoint competitors include DeLorme, MapInfo, Mapquest.com, Rand McNally, Webraska Mobile Technologies, Google, and Yahoo!. The telematics market is also highly fragmented, with competitive offerings from IBM and automotive suppliers building on various real-time operating system platforms from commercial Linux vendors, QNX Software Systems, Wind River, and others. We believe that our products compete effectively by providing a familiar development framework that enables developers to easily write and deploy innovative applications for mobile or embedded devices; providing a flexible platform that allows customers and partners to build differentiated and profitable business models; and providing end users significant benefits such as ease of use, personal productivity, and better information management and control. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment. The home and entertainment business is highly competitive and is characterized by limited platform life cycles, frequent introductions of new products and titles, and the development of new technologies. The markets for our products are characterized by significant price competition. We anticipate continued pricing pressure from our competitors. From time to time, we have responded to this pressure by reducing prices on certain products. Our competitors vary in size from very small companies with limited resources to very large, diversified corporations with substantial financial and marketing resources. We compete primarily on the basis of price, product quality and variety, timing of product releases, and effectiveness of distribution and marketing. \n\nOur Xbox hardware business competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large established base of customers. The video game consoles have on average 5 to 7 year lifecycles. We have announced the expected release in the first half of fiscal year 2006 of a new console, the Xbox 360. Sony and Nintendo have also announced new versions of their game consoles. Success in this transition to the next generation of consoles depends on the computational power of the console, the ease of developing games for the console, the ability to provide new revenue sources such as advertising and downloadable content, and providing exclusive game content that is sought after by gamers. We believe the Xbox 360 is positioned well against competitive console products based on significant innovation in the hardware architecture, new developer tools, expanded revenue sources, and continued strong exclusive content from our 1 st party game franchises such as Halo. \n\nIn addition to competing against software published for non-Xbox platforms, our games business also competes with numerous companies that have been licensed by us to develop and publish software for the Xbox console. These competitors include Acclaim Entertainment, Activision, Atari, Capcom, Eidos, Electronic Arts, Sega, Take-Two Interactive, Tecmo, THQ, and Ubi Soft, among others. Our PC hardware products face aggressive competition from computer and other hardware manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners. Our MSTV business faces competition primarily from ad hoc, point-solutions that address sub-segments of the TV delivery platform, but do not provide end-to-end solutions for the network operator. Our largest MSTV competitors include IBM, Cisco, UTStarcom, and Siemens/Myrio. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 12 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item1A": " RISK FACTORS \n\n&#160; \n\nChallenges to our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins. Our business model is based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us. Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution of their products. We believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software, allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop innovative software that is useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. In recent years, a non-commercial software model has evolved that presents a growing challenge to the commercial software model. Under the non-commercial software model, open source software produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers and made available for license to end users without charge is distributed by firms at nominal cost that earn revenue on complementary services and products, without having to bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. The most notable example of open source software is the Linux operating system. There is a wide variety of other open source software available, such as Open Office.org and Eclipse. While we believe our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity, and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software, the popularization of the non-commercial software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model, including recent efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products. To the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance, sales of our products may decline, we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products, and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe face intense competition. We continue to experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. Our competitors range in size from Fortune 100 companies to small, single-product businesses that are highly specialized and open source community-based projects. While we believe the breadth of our businesses and product portfolio offers benefits to our customers that are a competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused on a narrower product line may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources to compete with us. In addition, barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low. The Internet as a distribution channel and non-commercial software model described above have reduced barriers to entry even further. Non-commercial software vendors are devoting considerable efforts to developing software that mimics the features and functionality of various of our products. In response to competitive factors, we are developing versions of our products with basic functionality that are sold at lower prices than the standard versions. See Part I, Item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors. These competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for marketing and sales incentives, resulting in lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights against piracy, infringement of our patents by third parties, or declining legal protection for intellectual property. We defend our intellectual property rights and combat unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights through a variety of techniques. Preventing unauthorized use or infringement of our rights is difficult. Piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us. While this adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the United States is more significant, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Moreover, future legal changes could make this even more challenging. Throughout the world, we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively, and revenue could be adversely affected by reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights for software developers or by compliance with additional legal obligations impacting the intellectual property rights of software developers. \n\n&#160; \n\nThird parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow. Responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on less favorable terms, require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products, or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements. If we are required to enter into such agreements or take such actions, our operating margins may decline as a result. We have made and expect to \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 13 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\ncontinue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses of broad patent portfolios, as part of our strategy to manage this risk. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is the most significant asset we own. While we license certain portions of our source code for various software programs and operating systems to a number of licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If an unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code could also increase certain risks described in the next paragraph. \n\n&#160; \n\nSecurity vulnerabilities in our products could lead to reduced revenues or to liability claims. Maintaining the security of computers and computer networks is an issue of critical importance for us and our customers. There are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. While this is an industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms, it affects our products in particular because hackers tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems and programs and we expect them to continue to do so. We devote significant resources to addressing these critical issues. We are focusing our efforts on engineering even more secure products, enhancing security and reliability options and settings when we deliver products, and providing guidance to help our customers make the best use of our products and services to protect against computer viruses and other attacks on their computing environment. In addition, we are working to improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released. We are also investing in mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed. We are also advising customers on how to help protect themselves from security threats through the use of our online automated security tools, our published security guidance, and the deployment of security software such as firewalls, antivirus, and other security software. The cost of these steps could adversely affect our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or to use competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of new technologies. Any of these actions by customers could adversely affect our revenue. We devote significant resources to improving the security design and engineering of our software. Nevertheless, actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. While our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to such liability claims, there is no assurance these provisions will be held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe are subject to government regulatory activity that affects how we design and market our products. Lawsuits brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in two separate actions were resolved through a Consent Decree that took effect in November 2001 and a Final Judgment entered in November 2002. These proceedings imposed regulatory constraints on our Windows operating system businesses, including limits on certain contracting practices, required disclosure of certain software program interfaces, limits on Microsoft&#146;s ability to ensure the visibility of certain Windows features in new PCs, and required licensing of certain communications protocols. While we believe we currently are in full compliance with the Decree and Judgment, if we fail to comply with them in the future additional restrictions could be imposed on us that would adversely affect our business. Moreover, there always remains the risk of new legal action, either by governments or private claimants including with respect to products that haven&#146;t been scrutinized in the past. \n\nIn March 2004, the European Commission determined that we must create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies, many of which are required for certain Web sites, software applications, and other aspects of Windows to function properly, and we must provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain communications protocols supported in Windows. Microsoft has appealed both determinations to European courts. As a result of the Commission decision, we have incurred and will continue to incur duplicative development costs (absent a court decision to reverse or limit this aspect of the ruling). The availability of these alternative versions of Windows in the market also may cause confusion that harms our reputation, including among consumers and with third party software and web site developers who rely on the functionality removed from these alternative versions. The Commission ruling obligates Microsoft to make available specifications for certain Windows communications protocol technologies on licensing terms that are closely regulated by the Commission. The \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 14 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\navailability of these licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of Microsoft&#146;s own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products. Unless reversed or limited on appeal, the ruling of the European Commission may be cited as a precedent in other proceedings that seek to limit our ability to continue to improve Windows by adding new functionality in response to consumer demand. The ruling also illustrates a risk that competition authorities in Europe or elsewhere may authorize competitors to distribute implementations of Microsoft communications protocols in source code form without proper contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. \n\nWe believe our integrated approach to delivery of product innovation benefits consumers and business. Current or future government regulatory efforts may hinder our ability to provide these benefits reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenues that come from them. \n\nOur online services are subject to government regulation of the Internet domestically and internationally in areas such as user privacy, data protection, and online content. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and sometimes may conflict. Compliance with these regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in penalties being imposed on us or orders that we cease conducting the noncompliant activity. \n\n&#160; \n\nOur business depends largely on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nDelays in product development schedules may adversely affect our revenues. The development of software products is a complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products, particularly any delays in the Windows Vista operating system, could adversely affect our revenue. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe make significant investments in new products and services that may not be profitable. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for new products, services, and technologies, including Windows Vista, Office 12, MSN Search, SQL Server, Windows Server and Xbox 360. Investments in new technology are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. Significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. \n\n&#160; \n\nDeclines in demand for software could occur. If overall market demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines significantly, or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. In addition, our revenue would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as providing significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers. We are making significant investments in the next release of the Windows operating system (Windows Vista) and the next release of the Microsoft Office System (Office 12). If these products are not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers, our revenue and operating margins could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. While management currently believes that resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations, the litigation and other claims noted above are subject to inherent uncertainties and management&#146;s view of these matters may change in the future. There exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 15 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe may be at risk of having insufficient supplies of certain Xbox 360 components or console inventory. Some components of the upcoming Xbox 360 are obtained from a single supplier and others may be subject to an industry- wide supply shortage. If a component delivery from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable or industry shortages occur, we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on a timely basis resulting in reduced console and game sales. Components are ordered based on forecasted console demand so we may experience component shortages for the Xbox 360. Similarly, if our demand forecasts for the existing Xbox console are inaccurate and exceed actual demand, we may have excess console inventory that may require us to record charges to cost of revenue for the excess inventory. Xbox 360 consoles will be assembled in Asia; disruptions in the supply chain may result in console shortages that would affect our revenues and operating margins. \n\n&#160; \n\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on our results of operations. \n\n&#160; \n\nChanges in accounting may affect our reported earnings and operating income. Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations for many aspects of our business, such as revenue recognition for software, accounting for financial instruments, and treatment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets, are highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules, their interpretation, or changes in our products or business could significantly change our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures, without a comparable underlying change in cash flow from operations. See Note 1 in &#147;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148; and &#147;Item 7. Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Critical Accounting Policies&#148; of this report. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe operate a global business that exposes us to additional risks. We operate in over 100 countries and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. Pressure to make our pricing structure uniform might require that we reduce the sales price of our software in the United States and other countries. Operations outside of the United States may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. While we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our future net revenues. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral economic and geo-political risks may affect our revenue and profitability. Softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenue. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries or generally and could require changes in our operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions may lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers. \n\n&#160; \n\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business. We are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems in the event of a major earthquake, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are located in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are near major \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 16 ##TABLE_END Part I \n\nItem 1 \n\n&#160; \n\nearthquake faults. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be adversely affected. \n\n&#160; \n\nAcquisitions and joint ventures may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions or entering into joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we don&#146;t realize a satisfactory return on the investment we make, or that we may experience difficulty in the integration of new employees, business systems and technology, or diversion of management&#146;s attention from our other businesses. These factors could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. \n\n&#160; \n\nWe have limited insurance. We maintain third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss. Because of the unavailability or high cost of conventional insurance arrangements, we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets. As of June 30, 2005, the face value of captive insurance arrangements was $2.0 billion. Actual value at any particular time will vary due to deductibles, exclusions, other restrictions, and claims. While we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with the risks discussed in this report or other events could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements. \n\n&#160; \n\nOther risks that may affect our business. Other factors that may affect our performance may include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; sales channel disruption, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; our ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth; and ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; the continued availability of third-party distribution channels for MSN service and other online services. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT \n\n&#160; \n\nOur executive officers as of August 25, 2005 were as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START Name &#160; Age &#160; Position with the Company William H.

Of the total, 24,000 were in product research and development, 18,000 in sales and marketing, 12,000 in product support and consulting services, 2,000 in manufacturing and distribution, and 5,000 in general and administration. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software industry. We believe we have been successful in our efforts to recruit qualified employees, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be as successful in the future. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. \n\n&#160; \n\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION \n\n&#160; \n\nOur Internet address is www.microsoft.com. There we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the SEC. Our SEC reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of our Web site. The information found on our Web site is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. \n\n&#160; \n\n", "item7": " ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF \n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n\n&#160; \n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2003, 2004, AND 2005 \n\n&#160; \n\nOVERVIEW \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (MD&#38;A) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&#38;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements (Notes). \n\nWe develop, manufacture, license, and support a wide range of software products for many computing devices. Our software products include operating systems for servers, PCs, and intelligent devices; server applications for distributed computing environments; information worker productivity applications; business solutions applications; and software development tools. We provide consulting and product support services, and we train and certify system integrators and developers. We sell the Xbox video game console and games, PC games, and PC peripherals. Online communication and information services are delivered through our MSN portals and channels around the world. \n\nOur revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been the highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers. Our Home and Entertainment segment is particularly subject to seasonality as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season. Historically, approximately 40% to 50% of Home and Entertainment revenue has been generated in the second fiscal quarter. We believe the seasonality of revenue is likely to continue in the future. \n\nWe intend to sustain the long-term growth of our businesses through technological innovation, engineering excellence, and a commitment to delivering high-quality products and services to customers and partners. Recognizing that one of our primary challenges is to help accelerate worldwide PC adoption and software upgrades, we continue to advance the functionality, security, and value of Windows operating systems, including versions for new devices such as Tablet PCs, Media Center PCs, Portable Media Centers, and mobile devices such as Smartphones. We are also increasing our focus on emerging markets and reducing the amount of unlicensed software in those markets. In addition, we develop innovative software applications and solutions to enhance the productivity of information workers, improve communication and collaboration in work groups, aid business intelligence, and streamline processes for small and mid-sized businesses. To sustain the growth of our Server and Tools business amid competition from other vendors of both proprietary and open source software, our goal is to deliver products that provide the best platform for network computing &#150; the most advanced, easiest to deploy and manage and most secure &#150; with the lowest total cost of ownership. \n\nTo take advantage of new market opportunities, we continue to invest in research and development of existing and new lines of business, such as services for consumers, businesses and large enterprises that we believe can contribute significantly to our long-term growth. We also research and develop advanced technologies for future software products. Delivering breakthrough innovation and high-value solutions through our integrated platform is the key to meeting customer needs and to our future growth. \n\nWe believe that over the last few years we have laid a foundation for long-term growth by delivering innovative new products, creating opportunity for partners, improving customer satisfaction with key audiences, putting some of our most significant legal cases behind us, and improving our internal business processes. Our focus in fiscal year 2006 is building on this foundation and executing well in key areas, including continuing to innovate on our integrated software platform, delivering compelling value propositions to customers, responding effectively to customer and partner needs, and continuing to focus internally on product excellence, business efficacy, and accountability across the company. \n\nKey market opportunities include: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Growth in our anchor businesses through forthcoming innovations and new product launches and making inroads against software piracy. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Expanding our innovation portfolio by offering extensions of our technologies targeted towards specific customer needs &#150; either as new products or as higher-value versions of existing products. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#149; &#160; Delivering software services through online consumer services and services for businesses that enable workers to collaborate interactively. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 22 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nWorldwide macroeconomic factors have a strong correlation to business and consumer demand for our software, services, games and Internet service offerings. We expect that general macroeconomic trends will remain stable or experience slight improvement in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. Our optimism is balanced by recent data which revealed slight downward revisions when compared to previous forecasts for Gross Domestic Product growth in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan and Latin America. The leading indicators were also revised slightly lower for the major markets. Additionally, recent surveys of chief information officers also reflect slight downward revisions in expected corporate IT spend budgets and short-term purchase intent. \n\nAs open source software development and distribution evolves, we continue to seek to differentiate our products from competitive products based on open source software. We believe that Microsoft&#146;s share of server unit operating systems held steady in fiscal year 2005, while Linux distributions rose slightly faster on an absolute basis. \n\n&#160; \n\nSummary \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 32,187 &#160; $ 36,835 &#160; 14 % &#160; $ 39,788 &#160; 8 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 9,545 &#160; $ 9,034 &#160; (5 )% &#160; $ 14,561 &#160; 61 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nOur revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was driven by growth in licensing of Windows Server &#153; operating systems and other server applications, licensing of Windows &#174; Client operating systems through OEMs, and increased licensing of Office and other Information Worker products. The license revenue growth resulted from growth in server hardware and PC shipments, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and overall improvements in IT spending. The November 2004 launch of the &#147;Halo 2 &#174; &#148; Xbox game also contributed to the overall revenue growth for the company. Based on our preliminary estimates, worldwide PC shipments from all sources grew about 11% to 13% and total server hardware shipments grew approximately 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 as compared to fiscal year 2004. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in 2005, primarily due to relative strengthening of most foreign currencies, particularly the euro and Japanese yen, against the U.S. dollar. Had the exchange rates from the previous year been in effect in fiscal year 2005, translated international revenue growth earned in local currencies would have been approximately $873 million or two percentage points lower for fiscal year 2005. We hedge a portion of our international currency exposures, thereby reducing our overall exposure. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have a greater impact on non-OEM commercial and retail license business as a significant portion of those product revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. The vast majority of OEM license revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Partially offsetting revenue growth rates was a $1.1 billion decline in earned revenue from Upgrade Advantage in fiscal year 2005. The Upgrade Advantage contract value reached its expiration dates in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005. This revenue was recognized over fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 and in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 when the contract period expired. \n\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by the growth in licensing of Windows Client operating systems through OEMs, Windows Server operating systems, Office and other server applications as a result of growth in PC and server hardware shipments. The worldwide PC shipment growth rate from all sources was estimated at 13% and the Windows server shipment was estimated at 18% in fiscal year 2004 as compared to fiscal year 2003. The net impact of foreign exchange rates on revenue was positive in fiscal year 2004 due to a relative strengthening of most foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar. This resulted in approximately $1.10 billion growth in total revenue. Revenue growth in fiscal year 2003 was driven primarily by multi-year licensing that occurred before the Licensing 6.0 transition date in the first quarter of fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year 2003 revenue growth also reflected a $933 million or 13% increase associated with OEM licensing of Windows operating systems and a $309 million or 23% increase in revenue from Xbox video game consoles. \n\nFor fiscal year 2005, the operating income increase was driven by a decline in stock-based compensation expense; increased revenue in Server and Tools, Client and Information Worker, which have higher gross margins as compared to other segments; and a reduction in legal costs associated with major litigation. In addition, strong sales of Halo 2 reduced the overall operating loss for the Home and Entertainment segment for fiscal year 2005. The $3.29 billion decrease in stock-based compensation expense was partially offset by increased operating expenses of $562 million related to increased salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. General and administrative expenses related to major litigation declined in fiscal year 2005 due to the $2.53 billion of charges related to the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 23 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nsettlement of Sun Microsystems litigation and the fine imposed by the European Commission in fiscal year 2004. This effect was partially offset by legal expenses of $2.08 billion related to settlements with IBM, Novell, Gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs to resolve antitrust issues and other matters. In fiscal year 2004, the operating income decline was caused primarily by $2.53 billion of legal charges and $2.21 billion of stock-based compensation expense related to our employee stock option transfer program, mainly offset by an increase in revenue. In fiscal year 2003, the growth in operating income reflected an increase in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses related to employee and related costs associated with headcount and increased legal settlement expenses, primarily the Time Warner settlement charge of $750 million. \n\nIn fiscal year 2004, we implemented changes in employee compensation whereby employees are granted stock awards rather than stock options. We also completed an employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 in which employees could elect to transfer all of their vested and unvested stock options with a strike price of $33 or higher to JPMorgan. The unvested options that were transferred to JPMorgan became vested upon the transfer. A total of 345 million of the 621 million eligible options were transferred, which resulted in additional stock-based compensation expense of $2.21 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. As a result of these changes, we expect stock-based compensation expense to continue to decrease for at least the next three fiscal years. \n\nThe following table shows total stock-based compensation expense by segment and by income statement classification for fiscal years 2003, 2004 and 2005. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Increase/ \n\n(Decrease) \n\n&#160; 2005 &#160; Increase/ \n\n(Decrease) \n\n&#160; Client \n\n&#160; $ 454 &#160; $ 754 &#160; $ 300 &#160; $ 310 &#160; $ (444 ) Server and Tools \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,281 &#160; &#160; 1,898 &#160; &#160; 617 &#160; &#160; 826 &#160; &#160; (1,072 ) Information Worker \n\n&#160; &#160; 407 &#160; &#160; 573 &#160; &#160; 166 &#160; &#160; 269 &#160; &#160; (304 ) Microsoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; &#160; 237 &#160; &#160; 324 &#160; &#160; 87 &#160; &#160; 149 &#160; &#160; (175 ) MSN \n\n&#160; &#160; 263 &#160; &#160; 415 &#160; &#160; 152 &#160; &#160; 174 &#160; &#160; (241 ) Mobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; &#160; 130 &#160; &#160; 170 &#160; &#160; 40 &#160; &#160; 75 &#160; &#160; (95 ) Home and Entertainment \n\n&#160; &#160; 261 &#160; &#160; 387 &#160; &#160; 126 &#160; &#160; 168 &#160; &#160; (219 ) Corporate \n\n&#160; &#160; 716 &#160; &#160; 1,213 &#160; &#160; 497 &#160; &#160; 477 &#160; &#160; (736 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consolidated \n\n&#160; $ 3,749 &#160; $ 5,734 &#160; $ 1,985 &#160; $ 2,448 &#160; $ (3,286 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Cost of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 380 &#160; &#160; 681 &#160; &#160; 301 &#160; &#160; 318 &#160; &#160; (363 ) Research and development \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,964 &#160; &#160; 3,117 &#160; &#160; 1,153 &#160; &#160; 1,241 &#160; &#160; (1,876 ) Sales and marketing \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,050 &#160; &#160; 1,272 &#160; &#160; 222 &#160; &#160; 612 &#160; &#160; (660 ) General and administrative \n\n&#160; &#160; 355 &#160; &#160; 664 &#160; &#160; 309 &#160; &#160; 277 &#160; &#160; (387 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consolidated \n\n&#160; $ 3,749 &#160; $ 5,734 &#160; $ 1,985 &#160; $ 2,448 &#160; $ (3,286 ) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nIn fiscal year 2006, we expect revenue to grow at a higher rate than fiscal year 2005, mainly due to the launches of new products. We expect higher revenue growth in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005 in Home and Entertainment primarily driven by the launch of Xbox 360. We estimate worldwide PC shipments will grow between 7% to 9% and worldwide server unit shipments will grow between 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006 as compared to fiscal year 2005. We do not expect a benefit from year-over-year foreign currency exchange rates in fiscal year 2006. \n\nWe expect our operating income growth rate in fiscal year 2006 to exceed our revenue growth rate. Operating income is expected to reflect lower operating expenses due to lower costs for legal settlements than incurred in fiscal year 2005 and a reduction in stock-based compensation expense. The operating loss for Home and Entertainment is expected to increase in fiscal year 2006 driven by the launch of and investments in Xbox 360. \n\n&#160; \n\nSEGMENT PRODUCT REVENUE/OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) \n\n&#160; \n\nOur seven segments are Client; Server and Tools; Information Worker; Microsoft Business Solutions; MSN; Mobile and Embedded Devices; and Home and Entertainment. \n\nThe revenue and operating income/(loss) amounts in this section are presented on a basis consistent with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and include certain reconciling items attributable to each of the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 24 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nsegments. The segment information appearing in Note 18 &#150; Segment Information of the Notes to Financial Statements is presented on a basis consistent with the Company&#146;s internal management reporting, in accordance with SFAS No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information . Certain corporate level expenses have been excluded from our segment operating results and are analyzed separately. Fiscal years 2003 and 2004 amounts have been restated for certain internal reorganizations and to conform to the current period presentation including reclassifying certain legal settlements from business segments to corporate-level expense. \n\n&#160; \n\nClient \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 10,394 &#160; $ 11,546 &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 12,234 &#160; 6 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 7,960 &#160; $ 8,654 &#160; 9 % &#160; $ 9,442 &#160; 9 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nClient includes revenue from Windows XP Professional and Home, Media Center Edition, Tablet PC Edition, and other standard Windows operating systems. Client revenue growth is correlated with the growth of corporate and consumer purchases of PCs from OEMs that pre-install versions of Windows operating systems because the OEM channel accounts for over 80% of total Client revenue. The operating results for all periods presented have been restated to reflect the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client. \n\nClient revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 driven by 12% growth in OEM license units and $886 million or 10% growth in OEM revenue from increased PC unit shipments, partially offset by a $198 million or 9% decrease in revenue from commercial and retail licensing of Windows operating systems. This channel-mix shift reflects our customers&#146; continued preference for upgrading their PC operating systems through the OEM channel when they replace their PCs versus the purchase of a multi-year licensing agreement. The mix of OEM Windows operating systems licensed with premium edition operating systems as a percentage of total OEM Windows operating systems licensed during the year remained flat at 50% of total OEM Windows operating systems as compared to the previous year. Revenue earned from Upgrade Advantage declined by $99 million in fiscal year 2005 contributing to the decrease in commercial and retail licensing revenue. The differences between unit growth rates and revenue growth rates from year to year are affected by the mix of premium versions of operating systems licensed during the year, changes in the geographical mix, the channel mix of products sold by large, multi-national OEMs versus those sold by local and regional system builders, and previous changes to deferral rates and product lives for undelivered elements of unearned revenue. Client revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was driven by 14% growth in OEM licenses and 16% growth in OEM revenue on increased consumer PC unit shipments in the first half of the fiscal year and growth in business PC unit shipments in the second half of fiscal year 2004. \n\nClient operating income increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to an increase in OEM revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. These factors were partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with &#147;Start Something,&#148; a globally launched advertising campaign, marketing for security initiatives, and an increase in salary and benefits for new and existing headcount. The additional headcount for research and development was primarily devoted to the continued development of the Windows Client next-generation operating system. The operating income for fiscal year 2004 has been restated for a reclassification of legal settlement charges totaling $700 million from Client to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation. Client operating income increased for fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 mainly due to growth in revenue, partially offset by increased operating expenses primarily related to stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. \n\nWe anticipate that worldwide PC shipments will grow at approximately 7% to 9% in fiscal year 2006, continuing to influence our growth in Client revenue. In addition, we estimate that increasing shipments of laptops as a percentage of total PC systems will continue to positively influence Client revenue growth due to shorter replacement cycles for laptops. The time between operating system releases may affect our ability to close some multi-year licensing agreements. We expect growth rates in emerging markets to continue to outpace mature market growth rates. Piracy continues to be a challenge in both emerging and mature markets. We intend to focus on growing OEM licenses faster than the overall market by reducing piracy, particularly in the mature markets, through initiatives such as Windows Genuine Advantage. Client commercial and retail licensing revenues are expected to continue to lag behind overall Client revenue growth, but we expect to see improvements in these channels in fiscal year 2006 compared to fiscal year 2005. We anticipate a modest increase in our premium product mix in fiscal year 2006, although we \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 25 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nanticipate shipments of the premium-priced Media Center Edition will grow as a percentage of the total operating system shipments. Major investments in fiscal year 2006 will focus on development of Windows Vista, the next-generation PC operating system, and will include marketing initiatives such as the global &#147;Start Something&#148; campaign. \n\n&#160; \n\nServer and Tools \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 7,192 &#160; $ 8,538 &#160; 19 % &#160; $ 9,885 &#160; 16 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 1,160 &#160; $ 1,418 &#160; 22 % &#160; $ 3,259 &#160; 130 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nServer and Tools consists of server software licenses and client access licenses (CALs) for Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server &#174; , Exchange Server, and other server products. It also includes developer tools, training, certification, Microsoft Press, Premier and Professional product support services, and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server and Tools concentrates on licensing products, applications, tools, content, and services that make information technology professionals and developers more productive and efficient. The segment uses multiple channels for licensing including pre-installed OEM versions, licenses through partners, and licenses directly to end customers. The licenses are sold both as one-time licenses and as multi-year volume licenses depending upon the needs of different customers. Server and Tools uses product innovation and partnerships with information technology professionals to drive the adoption and sales growth of its products. Server and Tools growth is driven by performance of the overall market for information technology &#150; both hardware and software. The operating results for previous years have been restated for the reorganization of the Windows Security group from Server and Tools to Client and the reorganization of Professional product support services from Information Worker to Server and Tools. \n\nServer and Tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2005 was mainly driven by growth in Server and Server application revenue, including CAL revenue, which grew $1.1 billion or 17% in fiscal year 2005 reflecting broad adoption of Windows Server System &#153; products, including Windows Server, SQL Server, Exchange Server, and Management Servers. We estimate that overall server hardware shipments grew 13% to 14% during fiscal year 2005 and that Windows-based server shipments grew at a comparable rate for the same period. Consulting and Premier and Professional product support services revenue increased $241 million or 19% compared to the previous year, primarily due to increased consultant utilization and new Premier customers. Foreign currency exchange rate changes accounted for approximately $284 million or three percentage points of total Server and Tools revenue growth, which was offset by a $314 million decline in Upgrade Advantage revenue earned. In fiscal year 2004, Server and Server applications revenue, including CAL revenue, grew $1.28 billion or 25%. Foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately $350 million or five percentage points of Server and Tools revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003. Consulting and Premier product support services revenue increased $192 million or 18% compared to fiscal year 2003 due to increased customer penetration from new product offerings. \n\nServer and Tools operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to an increase in revenue and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. This was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing costs and headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits. Operating income for the previous year has been restated for a reclassification of $1.22 billion of legal settlements from Server and Tools to corporate expenses to conform to the current year presentation. Server and Tools operating income for fiscal year 2004 increased slightly due to the revenue increase offset by increased stock-based compensation charges, including $651 million related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. \n\nWe expect worldwide server hardware shipments to grow 11% to 13% in fiscal year 2006. However, we face strong competition from Linux-based, Unix, and other server operating systems. We anticipate little or no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate impacts in fiscal year 2006. We also expect Server and Tools operating expenses to increase during fiscal year 2006 due to expected investment in headcount and new marketing initiatives and upcoming product releases, including SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 26 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nInformation Worker \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 9,113 &#160; $ 10,653 &#160; 17 % &#160; $ 11,013 &#160; 3 % Operating income \n\n&#160; $ 6,389 &#160; $ 7,410 &#160; 16 % &#160; $ 7,915 &#160; 7 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nInformation Worker consists of the Microsoft Office System of programs, servers, services, and solutions designed to increase personal, team, and organization productivity. Information Worker includes Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio &#174; , SharePoint &#174; Portal Server CALs, and other information worker products including Microsoft LiveMeeting &#174; and OneNote &#174; . Most revenue from this segment comes from licensing our Office System products. Revenue growth depends on the ability to add value to the core Office product set and expand our product offerings in other information worker areas such as document lifecycle management, collaboration, and business intelligence. Beginning in fiscal year 2005, the Small and Mid-Market Solutions &#38; Partners (SMS&#38;P) organization, which was historically part of Information Worker, was re-aligned in Microsoft Business Solutions. As a result of this change, Information Worker results have been restated to reflect the reclassification of the SMS&#38;P organization to Microsoft Business Solutions. The results for previous periods have also been restated due to the reclassification of Professional product support services from Information Worker into Server and Tools. \n\nInformation Worker revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a 3% or $269 million increase in volume licensing, retail packaged product, and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan, a 6% or $91 million increase in OEM revenue, and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by reduced Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for approximately $367 million or three percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 as compared to the previous fiscal year, offset by a $663 million decline in Upgrade Advantage earned revenue. Revenue growth for fiscal year 2004 from volume licensing, retail packaged product and pre-installed versions of Office in Japan was 15% in aggregate. This increase was driven by recognition of unearned revenue primarily from a large increase in multi-year licenses signed previous to the transition to our Licensing 6.0 programs and approximately $110 million related to the launch of Office 2003. OEM licensing revenue grew 29% or $325 million. Foreign currency exchange rates provided approximately $485 million or 5% of total Information Worker revenue growth. \n\nInformation Worker operating income growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to the revenue growth and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. Operating expenses were also impacted by a reduction in marketing campaign costs from the previous period associated with the launch of Office 2003. This decline was offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits. Information Worker operating income in fiscal year 2004 increased from the previous year primarily due to growth in revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, primarily related to $351 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004 and higher sales and marketing expenses. \n\nThe revenue growth rate for Information Worker is expected to be higher in fiscal year 2006 than fiscal year 2005. We expect sustained momentum in our OEM and multi-year licensing offerings and increased purchasing of Office System 2003 as enterprises complete their product evaluations. We expect to see slowing revenue from packaged product late in the year as we approach the next version launch. We anticipate little or no year-over-year foreign currency exchange rate benefit in fiscal year 2006. \n\n&#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 631 &#160; &#160; $ 759 &#160; &#160; 20 % &#160; $ 803 &#160; &#160; 6 % Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (148 ) &#160; $ (315 ) &#160; (113 )% &#160; $ (201 ) &#160; 36 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions provides integrated and adaptable business management software solutions optimized for small and mid-sized businesses, large organizations and divisions of global enterprises.

Also as a result of the reorganization, the Microsoft Partner Program became a component of Microsoft Business Solutions. \n\nThe increase in Microsoft Business Solutions revenue in fiscal year 2005 was mainly due to a 10% revenue growth in software partially offset by a 25% decline in services revenue, which resulted from encouraging our partners to provide more of these types of services. The software revenue increase was driven by a 9% growth in license revenue and 16% growth in enhancement revenue as compared to the previous year, and is attributed to growth in our line of business solutions and customer relationship management solutions, and increased Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions. The revenue increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily attributable to continued growth in licensing of Navision and Axapta line of business solutions, new sales of Microsoft CRM, and Microsoft Partner Program subscriptions. \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions operating loss declined in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to a decline in stock-based compensation expense, an increase in product revenue, and a decline in acquisition intangibles amortization. The reduction in operating loss was partially offset by a net increase in sales and marketing expense driven by incremental headcount and marketing costs in the SMS&#38;P organization. In addition, there has been an increase in marketing and product development investments in our portfolio of business solutions. The operating loss for fiscal year 2004 increased from fiscal year 2003 due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, partially offset by an increase in revenue and lower operating expenses including $42 million of lower intangibles amortization costs. \n\nMicrosoft Business Solutions expects continued revenue growth through its portfolio of business solutions and related product releases, including newer applications such as Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting and Microsoft CRM. Continued investment in the next generation of solutions, broader geographical coverage, and plans for facilitating our partners to provide customized vertical solutions should result in improved business performance for Microsoft Business Solutions in fiscal year 2006. \n\n&#160; \n\nMSN \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 1,953 &#160; &#160; $ 2,216 &#160; 13 % &#160; $ 2,274 &#160; 3 % Operating income (loss) \n\n&#160; $ (573 ) &#160; $ 87 &#160; 115 % &#160; $ 405 &#160; 366 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMSN includes personal communications services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, and online information offerings, such as MSN Search and the MSN portals and channels around the world. MSN also provides a variety of online paid services in addition to MSN Internet Access and MSN Premium Web Services. Revenue is derived primarily from advertisers on MSN, from consumers and partners through subscriptions and transactions generated from online paid services, and from subscribers to MSN Narrowband Internet Access. In fiscal year 2005, we launched a new version of our MSN Search engine, which is based on our own technology. This change will help provide the ability to innovate more quickly and the opportunity to develop a long-term competitive advantage in search. In addition to the launch of MSN Search, we introduced many new products and product enhancements in fiscal year 2005, including a new version of the MSN home page which provides a richer user experience, quicker load times, higher levels of end user customization, and fewer advertisements and links. MSN launched the clarity in advertising program in fiscal year 2005, which removed paid advertising from inclusion in search results and resulted in a reduced number of advertisements that are returned with search results. \n\nIn fiscal year 2005, MSN advertising revenue increased $193 million or 16% primarily as a result of industry and market growth, and continued growth of MSN display advertising revenue, tempered by the search clarity in \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 28 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nadvertising program and the impact of the home page redesign. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet Access increased $84 million or 88% in fiscal year 2005 as a result of growth in the number of MSN Premium subscribers through our carrier partnerships. Offsetting the overall revenue growth was a decline of $219 million or 24% in Internet Access revenue, driven by the continued migration of Internet Access subscribers to broadband or other competitively priced Internet service providers. At the end of the current fiscal year, MSN had 2.7 million internet access subscribers and 9.1 million total subscribers compared to 4.3 million and 8.8 million at the end of the previous year. In addition, MSN has over 420 million unique users monthly, over 205 million active Hotmail accounts, and over 175 million active Messenger accounts. In fiscal year 2004, MSN advertising revenue increased $360 million or 43% as a result of growth in paid search and growth in the overall Internet advertising market. This increase was partially offset by a decline of $168 million or 15% in Internet Access revenue. Revenue from subscription and transaction services other than Internet Access increased $71 million. \n\nIn fiscal year 2005, MSN operating income increased mainly due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, reduced online operations and bandwidth costs associated with the Internet Access business as the number of subscribers declines, and increased advertising and subscription revenue. The operating income increase was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs from increased hiring and increases in salary and benefits, and a $48 million tax benefit recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004. MSN reached profitability in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004 and was profitable for fiscal year 2004. The improvement in profitability in fiscal year 2004 was primarily driven by an increase in revenue, a decline in customer acquisition costs and other expenses related to the Internet Access business, efficiency gains in the operations of the advertising and subscription businesses, and a $48 million refund of previous year taxes, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense. \n\nMSN expects increased growth in advertising revenue as it benefits from improvements to its advertising platform and search engine and continued increases in Internet spending. We expect revenue from narrowband Internet Access to continue to decline in fiscal year 2006. Profitability may decline in fiscal year 2006 as investments are made in the development of new applications and services, the search and search monetization platform, and growth in the field sales force. MSN may from time to time continue to make investments in improving the user experience and in some cases, the number of advertisements delivered either via our search tools or via our Internet portals may be reduced to improve the overall user experience thereby helping to sustain and grow our user base. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. This reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN reported results. \n\n&#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 156 &#160; &#160; $ 247 &#160; &#160; 58 % &#160; $ 337 &#160; &#160; 36 % Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (277 ) &#160; $ (219 ) &#160; 21 % &#160; $ (46 ) &#160; 79 % ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices includes Windows Mobile &#153; software, Windows Embedded operating systems, MapPoint &#174; , and Windows Automotive. These products extend the advantages of the Windows platform to mobile devices such as PDAs, phones, and a wide range of embedded devices. The business is also responsible for managing sales and customer relationships for Microsoft overall with device manufacturers and communication sector customers. The communication sector includes network service providers (such as wireless, wireline and cable operators), and media and entertainment companies. The market for products in these segments is intensely competitive. Competitive alternatives vary based on product lines and include product offerings from commercial and non-commercial mobile operating system providers, and proprietary software developed by OEMs and mobile operators. Short product lifecycles in product lines such as Windows Mobile software may impact our continuing revenue streams. \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices revenue growth for fiscal year 2005 was primarily due to unit volume increases in all major product lines, especially Windows Mobile software sales and Windows Embedded operating systems. Increased revenue for Windows Mobile software was primarily driven by increased market demand for connected mobile devices such as phone-enabled PDAs and Smartphones, and strong growth in volume shipments for \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 29 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nstandalone PDAs. The increase in Windows Embedded revenue was due to our operating system being included in new product designs for both new and existing customers. Mobile and Embedded Devices also benefited from the increased demand for on-line mapping and the introduction of new MapPoint finished goods products. This new functionality resulted in increased unit sales for Mobile, Embedded, and MapPoint product categories. In fiscal year 2005, revenue for Windows Mobile software increased $46 million or 45%, revenue for Windows Embedded operating systems increased $19 million or 21% and revenue for MapPoint and Windows Automotive increased $25 million or 45%. Mobile and Embedded Devices realized positive increases in customer satisfaction ratings from both mobile operator partners and the developer community. In fiscal year 2005, Mobile and Embedded Devices released Windows Mobile 5.0 which is the latest version of our mobile operating software. Unit volume increases drove revenue growth for fiscal year 2004 over fiscal year 2003 in all major product lines. The growth was primarily due to the increased number of OEMs and mobile operators shipping Windows Mobile software for Smartphones, increases in market share for our Pocket PC and embedded products and increased usage by existing customers of our MapPoint Web Service. \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for fiscal year 2005 decreased compared to fiscal year 2004 primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The growth in revenue and a reduction in sales and marketing expense also contributed to improved operating results in this period compared to the previous year. This improvement has been partially offset by increased salary and benefit costs from increased hiring and increased investment in research and development. The Mobile and Embedded Devices operating loss for fiscal year 2004 decreased compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to growth in revenue and lower marketing expenses, partially offset by $58 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. \n\nMobile and Embedded Devices is committed to continuing product innovation to meet the growing needs of our customers and partners. We will continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to develop and market evolving software solutions. In fiscal year 2006 we expect to bring added functionality to the Windows Mobile 5.0 platform through the Windows Mobile 5.0 Messaging and Security Feature Pack and the Exchange Server 2003 Service Pack 2. This solution enables business users to easily stay connected to their Microsoft Office Outlook Mobile information and helps businesses to better protect device data. We expect sales for Mobile and Embedded Devices to continue to grow in fiscal year 2006. The growth is anticipated to be driven by an overall increase in customer demand for connectivity, and an increase in the number of new devices being offered by OEMs and mobile operators incorporating Windows Mobile software and Windows Embedded operating systems. Growth is also anticipated due to a strong focus on increasing segment share in the connected device space by working with our partners to bring to market a strong portfolio of Smartphone and mobile computing devices. In addition, we are focused on bringing to market applications and services on the Windows Mobile platform that fulfill our customers desire for personalized communication devices. Effective July 1, 2005, functions related to MapPoint in Mobile and Embedded Devices have been moved to MSN. This reorganization will result in a corresponding change to the Mobile and Embedded Devices and MSN reported results. \n\n&#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent Change Revenue \n\n&#160; $ 2,748 &#160; &#160; $ 2,876 &#160; &#160; 5% &#160; $ 3,242 &#160; &#160; 13% Operating loss \n\n&#160; $ (1,191 ) &#160; $ (1,220 ) &#160; (2)% &#160; $ (391 ) &#160; 68% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nHome and Entertainment includes the Microsoft Xbox video game console system, PC games, the Home Products Division (HPD), and TV platform products for the interactive television industry. The success of video game consoles is determined by console functionality, the portfolio of video game content for the console, and the market share of the console. Revenue and unit volumes have grown quickly since we entered the market in 2002 and we have established ourselves as one of the market leaders. We believe our competitive position and revenue is bolstered by our increasing software game attach rates, which provides higher margins to offset the declining prices on consoles sold. Xbox consoles have negative gross margins. \n\nHome and Entertainment revenue increased in fiscal year 2005 primarily due to significant new product launches, which resulted in a $416 million or 23% increase in Xbox revenue. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2005, we \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 30 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nintroduced Halo 2, which generated over $300 million in revenue in the fiscal year. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games, and TV platforms declined $50 million or 5% compared to fiscal year 2004 due to lower PC games software sales. In fiscal year 2004, Xbox revenue increased $144 million or 9% with $269 million related to higher Xbox software volumes and $117 million due to higher Xbox console volumes, partially offset by a $242 million decline related to price reductions of Xbox consoles and software. Overall, Xbox console volumes sales increased 11% in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003. Revenue from consumer hardware and software, PC games and TV platforms declined $16 million or 1% compared to fiscal year 2003 due to lower PC games software and PC gaming devices sales, partially offset by the new release of Mac Office. \n\nHome and Entertainment operating loss in fiscal year 2005 decreased primarily due to an increase in high margin Xbox software sales, lower Xbox console unit costs, the lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment recorded in fiscal year 2004, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in costs associated with Xbox 360 console development and launch efforts associated with it. The increase in operating loss in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to $141 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, increased sales of negative margin consoles, and costs associated with Xbox 360 console development efforts, partially offset by increased Xbox and Mac Office software sales. The operating loss increase from fiscal year 2003 also included a lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment of approximately $90 million related to Xbox console inventory. \n\nWe expect operating expenses to continue to increase as we near the launch of Xbox 360. As a result of launch-related activities, we expect our operating loss to increase in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2006, we expect Xbox console unit volumes and revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 due to launch of the Xbox 360. In fiscal year 2006 we expect PC games revenue to increase from fiscal year 2005 driven by more new game titles. \n\n&#160; \n\nCorporate-Level Expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; 2004 &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Percent Change &#160; Corporate-level Expenses \n\n&#160; $ 3,775 &#160; $ 6,781 &#160; 80 % &#160; $ 5,822 &#160; (14 )% ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCertain corporate-level expenses are not allocated to our segments. Those expenses primarily include corporate operations related to broad-based sales and marketing, product support services, human resources, legal, finance, information technology, corporate development and procurement activities, certain research and development and other costs, and all litigation settlements and accrued legal contingencies. \n\nIn fiscal year 2005, corporate-level expenses decreased primarily as a result of a reduction in stock-based compensation expense and decreased corporate legal costs. Fiscal year 2005 legal costs were $2.08 billion as compared to $2.53 billion in fiscal year 2004. The legal costs in both years were primarily related to antitrust and competition law claims brought by competitors, class actions on behalf of end users, and by government regulatory bodies outside the United States. \n\nIn fiscal year 2004, corporate-level expenses increased primarily due to legal costs including a $1.92 billion charge for a settlement with the Sun Microsystems, Inc., and the fine of &#128; 497 million ($605 million) imposed by the European Commission. In addition, stock-based compensation increased by $497 million as compared to fiscal year 2003. \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of Revenue \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent Change &#160; Cost of revenue \n\n&#160; $ 6,059 &#160; &#160; $ 6,716 &#160; &#160; 11 % &#160; $ 6,200 &#160; &#160; (8 )% As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; (1 )ppt &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; (2 )ppt ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCost of revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed, operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery of consulting services.

The increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to increased product support and consulting services costs of $508 million, $214 million of stock-based compensation expense from the employee stock option transfer program, and a lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 of approximately $90 million related to the Xbox console, partially offset by a $365 million decrease in MSN online operations costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; Research and development \n\n&#160; $ 6,595 &#160; &#160; $ 7,779 &#160; &#160; 18 % &#160; $ 6,184 &#160; &#160; (21 )% As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 21 % &#160; &#160; 21 % &#160; 0 ppt &#160; &#160; 16 % &#160; (5 )ppt ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Our research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower stock-based compensation expense. This expense decline was partially offset by an increase in headcount-related costs associated with incremental hiring and product development costs associated with upcoming products, primarily the Xbox 360 console and related games, SQL Server 2005, Windows Vista, and product development in Mobile and Embedded devices. The increase in fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to $1.31 billion of stock-based compensation expenses related to the option transfer program and other headcount-related payroll and other employee costs associated with a 3% increase in research and development headcount from fiscal year 2003. \n\n&#160; \n\nSales and Marketing \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; Sales and marketing \n\n&#160; $ 7,562 &#160; &#160; $ 8,309 &#160; &#160; 10% &#160; $ 8,677 &#160; &#160; 4 % As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 24 % &#160; &#160; 23 % &#160; (1)ppt &#160; &#160; 22 % &#160; (1 )ppt ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with sales and marketing personnel and advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other marketing-related programs. For fiscal year 2005, sales and marketing expense increased slightly due to $470 million higher headcount-related costs from hiring and salary increases; higher sales and marketing costs driven by product planning, reseller marketing, and advertising campaign costs mainly related to launch of the &#147;Start Something&#148; campaign; launch of Halo 2; and launch arrangements for Xbox 360. The increase was offset mainly by reductions in stock-based compensation expense. Sales and marketing costs increased in fiscal year 2004 due to $400 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the option transfer program and other headcount-related costs related to a 9% increase in sales and marketing headcount. \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and Administrative \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions, except percentages) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; &#160; Percent \n\nChange \n\n&#160; General and administrative \n\n&#160; $ 2,426 &#160; &#160; $ 4,997 &#160; &#160; 106 % &#160; $ 4,166 &#160; &#160; (17 )% As a percent of revenue \n\n&#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; &#160; 14 % &#160; 6 ppt &#160; &#160; 10 % &#160; (4 )ppt ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 32 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\nGeneral and administrative costs include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, and other headcount-related costs associated with finance, legal, facilities, certain human resources, and other administrative headcount; and legal costs and other administrative fees. General and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal year 2005 due to lower legal costs and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in other headcount-related costs from new and existing employees of $25 million. In fiscal year 2005, our legal expenses were driven by charges of $2.08 billion, nearly all of which were for settlements of certain antitrust claims with IBM, Novell, Gateway, and end-user class action plaintiffs, and increases in contingency reserves for anti-trust related claims. General and administrative costs increased in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to legal expenses including $1.92 billion of charges related to the Sun Microsystems settlement, a $605 million fine imposed by the European Commission, and other legal costs of approximately $104 million; $280 million of stock-based compensation expense related to the employee stock option transfer program in the second quarter of fiscal year 2004; and other headcount-related costs. \n\n&#160; \n\nInvestment Income \n\n&#160; \n\nThe components of investment income and other in each full fiscal year are as follows: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; 2003 &#160; &#160; 2004 &#160; &#160; 2005 &#160; Dividends and interest \n\n&#160; $ 1,957 &#160; &#160; $ 1,892 &#160; &#160; $ 1,460 &#160; Net gains on investments \n\n&#160; &#160; 44 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1,563 &#160; &#160; &#160; 856 &#160; Net losses on derivatives \n\n&#160; &#160; (424 ) &#160; &#160; (268 ) &#160; &#160; (262 ) Income/(losses) from equity investees and other \n\n&#160; &#160; (68 ) &#160; &#160; (25 ) &#160; &#160; 13 &#160; &#160; &#160; Investment income and other \n\n&#160; $ 1,509 &#160; &#160; $ 3,162 &#160; &#160; $ 2,067 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nDividends and interest income declined $432 million in fiscal year 2005 due to the combination of a greater allocation of funds to lower yielding, more liquid asset classes in preparation for the $32.64 billion special dividend paid on December 2, 2004 and a lower portfolio balance following payment of the special dividend. \n\nNet gains on investments declined $707 million in fiscal year 2005 due primarily to greater sales of investments in the previous fiscal year in preparation for the special dividend paid on December 2, 2004. Net gains on investments also include other-than-temporary impairments of $152 million in fiscal year 2005 compared to $82 million fiscal year 2004. Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary. We employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. \n\nDerivative instruments are used to manage exposures to interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Net derivative losses in fiscal year 2005 were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts. During fiscal year 2005, losses related to equity derivatives used to economically hedge against a decline in equity prices were $202 million and losses related to interest rate derivatives were $53 million. These losses were offset by the combination of realized gains on sales of securities and unrealized gains related to increases in the market value of the underlying assets included as a component of other comprehensive income. Net losses related to foreign currency contracts were $53 million, related in part to hedging anticipated foreign currency revenues while the U.S. dollar generally declined against most currencies during the current fiscal year, and economically hedging foreign currency based investment exposures. Losses related to hedging foreign currency-based investment exposures were offset by unrealized gains in the underlying assets. Net gains on derivatives also included gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification. Gains on commodity positions were $46 million during fiscal year 2005. \n\nIn fiscal year 2004, dividends and interest income decreased by $65 million mainly due to lower dividend income resulting from the exchange of AT&#38;T 5% convertible preferred debt for common shares of Comcast during fiscal year 2003 and declining interest rates, partly offset by a larger investment portfolio. Net gains on investments include \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 33 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nother-than-temporary impairments of $82 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to $1.15 billion in fiscal year 2003 and higher net realized gains on sales in fiscal year 2004 as we moved to more liquid investment asset classes. Net realized gains on sales were $1.65 billion in fiscal year 2004 and $1.19 billion in fiscal year 2003. The decline in impairments was due to improved market conditions. Derivative losses decreased $156 million to $268 million in fiscal year 2004 compared to fiscal year 2003 primarily due to the combined effects of interest rate movements on interest rate sensitive instruments and equity market price movements relative to positions used to hedge the fair value of certain equity securities. \n\nNet losses on equity investees and other for the previous periods were reclassified into investment income and other to conform to the current period presentation. \n\n&#160; \n\nIncome Taxes \n\n&#160; \n\nOur effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2005 was 26% compared with 33% for fiscal year 2004. The decreased rate for the full year resulted primarily from the reversal of $776 million of previously accrued taxes upon settling an Internal Revenue Service examination for fiscal years 1997 to 1999 and recording a tax benefit of $179 million generated by the decision to repatriate foreign subsidiary earnings under a temporary incentive provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2003 was 32%. The fiscal year 2003 rate reflected a benefit in the second quarter of $126 million which resulted from the reversal of previously accrued taxes that were related to a previous unfavorable Tax Court ruling, portions of which were reversed in 2003 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. \n\n&#160; \n\nFinancial Condition \n\n&#160; \n\nCash and short-term investments totaled $37.75 billion as of June 30, 2005 compared to $60.59 billion as of June 30, 2004. The decline is primarily attributable to the special dividend of $3.00 per share, or $32.64 billion, paid on December 2, 2004, and to common stock repurchases of 312 million shares for $8.0 billion during 2005. Equity and other investments were $11.00 billion as of June 30, 2005 compared to $12.21 billion as of June 30, 2004. The investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. Our investments are generally liquid and investment grade. The portfolio is invested predominantly in U.S. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign currency denominated positions in order to diversify financial risk. The portfolio is primarily invested in short-term securities to facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs. As a result of the special dividend and shares repurchased, our retained deficit, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $12.30 billion at June 30, 2005. Our retained deficit is not expected to impact our future ability to operate or pay dividends given our continuing profitability and strong cash and financial position. \n\n&#160; \n\nUnearned Revenue \n\n&#160; \n\nUnearned revenue is attributable to volume licensing programs, undelivered elements of software licensing arrangements, and certain other services. Unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings, paid either upfront or at the beginning of each billing coverage period, that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period. For certain other licensing arrangements revenue attributable to undelivered elements, including free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, is based on the sales price of those elements when sold separately and is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the related product&#146;s life cycle. Other unearned revenue includes Services, TV Platform, Microsoft Business Solutions, and advertising and subscription services where we have been paid upfront and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria. \n\nUnearned revenue as of June 30, 2005 increased $990 million from June 30, 2004 reflecting current period billings outpacing the recognition of deferrals from multi-year licensing arrangements by $925 million and a $304 million increase primarily in unearned revenue for services, MSN advertising and subscriptions, Xbox Live, TV platform, and Microsoft Business Solutions, partially offset by a $239 million decline in revenue deferred for undelivered elements. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 34 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table outlines the expected recognition of unearned revenue at June 30, 2005: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) &#160; Recognition of Unearned Revenue Three months ended: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; September 30, 2005 \n\n&#160; $ 2,724 December 31, 2005 \n\n&#160; &#160; 2,208 March 31, 2006 \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,612 June 30, 2006 \n\n&#160; &#160; 958 Thereafter \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,665 Unearned revenue \n\n&#160; $ 9,167 &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nCash Flows \n\n&#160; \n\nCash flow from operations for fiscal year 2005 increased 14% to $16.61 billion due primarily to an increase in cash receipts from customers driven by our 8% revenue growth combined with a 12% increase in unearned revenue. Cash payments in fiscal year 2005 resulting from significant legal settlements were approximately $1.8 billion lower than in the previous year, adding to the overall increase in operating cash flow. Partially offsetting these factors were increased payments to employees resulting from a 7% increase in full-time employees. Cash used for financing was $41.08 billion in fiscal year 2005, driven by $36.11 billion of cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005 compared to $1.73 billion paid in fiscal year 2004. The increase was also partially driven by $8.0 billion in cash used for common stock repurchases, an increase of $4.67 billion in cash used for share repurchases compared to the previous year, reflecting 312 million shares repurchased in fiscal year 2005, an increase of 188.5 million shares compared to the previous year. Net cash from investing was $15.03 billion in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $18.37 billion from fiscal year 2004, primarily due to a $23.59 billion increase in investment maturities that occurred to fund cash dividends paid in fiscal year 2005, partially offset by a $5.32 billion decrease in cash from combined investment purchase and sale activity. \n\nCash flow from operations for fiscal year 2004 decreased $1.17 billion to $14.63 billion. The decrease primarily reflects the combined cash outflows of $2.56 billion related to the Sun Microsystems settlement and the European Commission fine partially offset by increased cash receipts from customers driven by the rise in revenue billings. Cash used for financing was $2.36 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $2.86 billion from the previous year. The decrease reflects that we did not repurchase common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004 combined with a $628 million increase primarily from stock issuances related to employee stock options exercises, partially offset by an $872 million increase in cash dividends paid. We repurchased 123.7 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2004. Cash used for investing was $3.34 billion in fiscal year 2004, a decrease of $3.88 billion from fiscal year 2003. \n\nCash flow from operations was $15.80 billion for fiscal year 2003, an increase of $1.29 billion from fiscal year 2002. The increase primarily reflects the rise in cash receipts from customers driven by the increase in revenue billings and maintenance of relatively stable accounts receivable levels. Cash used for financing was $5.22 billion in fiscal year 2003, an increase of $651 million from the previous year. The increase reflects a cash dividend payment of $857 million in 2003 and an increase of $417 million in common stock repurchased, offsetting $623 million received from common stock issued. We repurchased 238.2 million shares of common stock under our share repurchase program in fiscal year 2003. Cash used for investing was $7.50 billion in fiscal year 2003, a decrease of $3.37 billion from fiscal year 2002, due to stronger portfolio performance on sold and matured investments. \n\nWe have no material long-term debt. Stockholders&#146; equity at June 30, 2005 was $48.12 billion. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. Commitments for constructing new buildings were $152 million on June 30, 2005. We have operating leases for most U.S. and international sales and support offices and certain equipment under which we incurred rental expense totaling, $290 million, $331 million and $299 million in fiscal year 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. We have issued residual value guarantees in connection with various operating leases. These guarantees provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 35 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nlessor at the end of the lease term, then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage (if any) between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value. As of June 30, 2005, the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately $271 million. We believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability currently exists. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of requirements for capital resources. \n\nIn fiscal year 2005, our Board of Directors approved $3.40 per share cash dividends, with $3.32 paid as of June 30, 2005. A quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share (or approximately $857 million) was approved by our Board of Directors on June 15, 2005 to be paid to shareholders of record as of August 17, 2005 on September 8, 2005. \n\nOn July 20, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to buy back up to $30 billion in Microsoft common stock over four years. The specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on market conditions, securities law limitations, and other factors. The repurchases will be made using our cash resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without previous notice. In any period, cash used in financing activities related to common stock repurchased may differ from the comparable change in stockholders&#146; equity, reflecting timing differences between the recognition of share repurchase transactions and their settlement for cash. During fiscal year 2005, we repurchased 312 million shares, or $8.0 billion of our common stock under this plan. \n\nWe believe existing cash and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements, quarterly dividends and planned share repurchases. Our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short-term investments, and equity and other investments, reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, share dilution management, legal risks, and challenges to our business model. We regularly assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs. \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements \n\n&#160; \n\nAs of June 30, 2004, we had guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of Jupiter Telecommunication, Ltd., a Japanese cable company. The total amount of these guarantees was approximately $51 million. Effective December 21, 2004, the guarantees were terminated. \n\nWe provide indemnifications of varying scope and amount to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products. We evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, as interpreted by FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 45. We consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements. \n\n&#160; \n\nContractual Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2005: \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (In millions) (1) &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Payments due by period Fiscal Years &#160; 2006 &#160; 2007-2009 &#160; 2010-2012 &#160; 2013 and thereafter &#160; Total Long-term debt \n\n&#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; &#160; $ &#150; Construction commitments (2) \n\n&#160; &#160; 122 &#160; &#160; 28 &#160; &#160; 2 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 152 Lease obligations: \n\n&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Capital leases \n\n&#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 34 Operating leases (3) \n\n&#160; &#160; 230 &#160; &#160; 493 &#160; &#160; 214 &#160; &#160; 96 &#160; &#160; 1,033 Purchase commitments (4) \n\n&#160; &#160; 1,072 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 1,073 Other long-term liabilities (5) \n\n&#160; &#160; &#150; &#160; &#160; 95 &#160; &#160; 17 &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; 124 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total contractual obligations \n\n&#160; $ 1,430 &#160; $ 634 &#160; $ 244 &#160; $ 108 &#160; $ 2,416 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 36 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START (1) &#160; We have excluded the $1.1 billion contingent liability related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits referred to in the third paragraph of Note 17 &#150; Contingencies of the Notes to Financial Statements as the timing and amount to be resolved in cash versus vouchers is subject to uncertainty. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (2) &#160; We have certain commitments for the construction of buildings. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (3) &#160; Our future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases comprise the majority of the operating lease obligations presented above. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (4) &#160; Purchase commitments represent obligations under agreements which are not unilaterally cancelable by us, are legally enforceable, and specify fixed or minimum amounts or quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices. We generally require purchase orders for vendor and third-party spending. The amount presented above as purchase commitments includes an analysis of all known contracts exceeding $5 million in the aggregate and all known open purchase orders. We expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flows from operations. ##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START (5) &#160; We have excluded unearned revenue of $1.67 billion from other long-term liabilities presented above as these will not be settled in cash. ##TABLE_END &#160; \n\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS \n\n&#160; \n\nIn November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs , which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material. SFAS No. 151 will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets , which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 will be effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have a material impact on our financial statements. \n\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment , which establishes standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. This standard requires an issuer to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. This eliminates the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25. In March 2005, the SEC released Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107, Share-Based Payment, which expresses views of the SEC Staff about the application of SFAS No. 123(R). In April 2005 the SEC issued a rule that SFAS No. 123(R) will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. We previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , on July 1, 2003 and restated previous periods at that time for all awards granted to employees after July 1, 1995. Accordingly we believe SFAS No. 123(R) will not have a material impact on our financial statements; however, we continue to assess the potential impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will have on the classification of tax deductions for stock-based compensation in our statements of cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\nAPPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES \n\n&#160; \n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management&#146;s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, impairment of goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation. \n\nWe account for the licensing of software in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. The application of SOP 97-2 requires judgment, including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements, and if so, whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) of fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis, the fair value of which is recognized over the product&#146;s estimated life cycle. Changes to the elements in a software arrangement, the \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 37 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nability to identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value of the respective elements, and changes to a product&#146;s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue. Judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products. \n\nSFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities , and SEC SAB 59, Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance on determining when an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and our intent and ability to hold the investment. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. \n\nSFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (July 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. \n\nWe account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS No. 2, Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed . SFAS No. 86 specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material, and accordingly, we expense all research and development costs when incurred. \n\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations. \n\nSFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes. The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity&#146;s financial statements or tax returns. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_START PAGE &#160; 38 ##TABLE_END Part II \n\nItem 7, 7A \n\n&#160; \n\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends. In addition, judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. \n\n&#160; \n\n"}}
