{"1995": {"item1": "Item 1. Business\n\nGeneral\n\nApple  Computer,  Inc. (\"Apple\" or the \"Company\") was incorporated  under\nthe  laws  of the State of California on January 3, 1977.  The  Company's\nprincipal  executive officers are located at 1 Infinite Loop,  Cupertino,\nCalifornia, 95014 and its telephone number is (408) 996-1010.\n\nThe   Company  designs,  manufactures  and  markets  microprocessor-based\npersonal  computers  and  related personal computing  products  for  sale\nprimarily   to  business,  education,  home,  and  government  customers.\nSubstantially  all of the Company's net sales to date have  been  derived\nfrom  the  sale  of personal computers from its Apple Macintosh (registered \ntrademark)  line  of computers and related software and peripherals.  The \nCompany operates  in one    principal   industry   segment   across   \ngeographically   diverse marketplaces.\n\nApple delivers a full range of information solutions to people in a  wide\nvariety  of  growing markets.  The Company's strategy is to maintain  and\nexpand  its  market  share  in  the  personal  computer  industry   while\ndeveloping  and expanding new related businesses, such as its  businesses\nin  on-line  services,  licensing  of  the  Macintosh  operating  system,\nclient/server systems and personal interactive electronics.\n\nDuring  1995, the Company continued a major product transition  to  Power\nMacintosh (registered trademark),  its  line  of  Macintosh  computers  \nbased  on  the  PowerPC (registered trademark) architecture,  a Reduced \nInstruction Set Computing (\"RISC\")  microprocessor jointly  developed by \nApple, International Business Machines  Corporation (\"IBM\")  and Motorola, \nInc.  The Company believes that these PowerPC  based products   yield   \nsignificant  improvements  in  price/performance   and functionality  \ncompared with its products built using the Motorola  68000 series  of  \nComplex  Instruction  Set Computing  (\"CISC\")  microprocessors. Further  \ninformation regarding this product transition may  be  found  in Part  II,  \nItem  7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  \"Form  10-K\") under  the  \nsubheading  \"Product Introductions and Transitions\"  included under  the  \nheading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" \nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nThe  Company  announced the licensing of the Macintosh  operating  system\n(\"Mac  OS\") to other personal computer vendors in January 1995 in an effort\nto  increase overall market share.  Several vendors are currently selling\nproduct  which utilizes Mac OS.  The Company believes that licensing  the\noperating  system  will  result  in a broader  installed  base  on  which\nsoftware  vendors can develop and provide technical innovations  for  the\nMacintosh platform.  Further information regarding the licensing  of  the\nMac OS may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \nsubheading \"Competition\" included under  the heading \"Factors That May \nAffect Future Results and Financial Condition\", which information is hereby \nincorporated by reference.\n\nPrincipal products\n\nThe Company offers a wide range of personal computing products, including\npersonal  computers, related peripherals, software,  and  networking  and\nconnectivity products.\n\nPersonal Computing Products\n\nApple  Macintosh personal computers were first introduced in  1984,  and \nare characterized by their intuitive ease of use, innovative applications \nbase, and built-in networking, graphics and multimedia capabilities.\n\nCurrently, the Company uses two types of microprocessors in its  line  of\npersonal  computing products: the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor,  and\nthe  Motorola  68000  CISC-based microprocessor.   The  majority  of  the\nCompany's products are built using the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor,\nwhich include the Power Macintosh (registered trademark) family of personal  \ncomputers  and certain  products  within  the  Macintosh Performa \n(registered trademark)  and  the  PowerBook \nfamilies  of personal computers. Products currently based on the Motorola\nseries  of  CISC-based  microprocessors include  the  Macintosh  LC,  and\ncertain  products  within  the  Macintosh  Performa  and  the  PowerBook\nfamilies  of  personal  computers.   Generally,  products  based  on  the\nMotorola series of microprocessors can also be upgraded to take advantage\nof the PowerPC processor.  The Company also offers DOS compatible systems\nwhich include built-in 68LC040 and 486DX2 processors enabling them to run\napplications,  games, and CD-ROM titles for MS-DOS 6.2  and  Windows  3.1\noperating systems as well as the Mac(trademark)OS operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n##PAGE\n\nPower Macintosh\n\nThe  Power  Macintosh  high-performance family of personal  computers  is\ntargeted at business and professional users and is designed\nto  meet  the speed, expansion and networking needs of the most demanding\nMacintosh  user.   These  Power  Macintosh  products  not  only   support\nvirtually  all existing Macintosh applications, but can also  run  MS-DOS\nand  Windows  applications when using SoftWindows (trademark) software from \nInsignia Solutions.\n\nMacintosh LC\n\nThe   LC  family  of  personal  computers  offers  high  performance  and\ncompetitive prices in a flexible, modular design.  LC personal  computers\nare  well-suited  for  education applications  such  as  graphics,  color\npresentations, multimedia, and spreadsheets.\n\nMacintosh Performa\n\nThe Performa family of personal computers is designed to appeal to first-\ntime  personal  computer  users.  These products feature  all-in-one  box\ncomputing  solutions, including software and hardware chosen specifically\nwith  home users in mind.  Performa products also include in-home service\nand unlimited toll-free telephone support.\n\nMacintosh PowerBook\n\nThe PowerBook family of notebook-sized personal computers is specifically\ndesigned  for  mobile computing needs.  All PowerBook personal  computers\ninclude  the  PowerBook Mobility Bundle, a combination of communications,\npower-management,  security, compatibility,  and  entertainment  software\ndesigned to enhance mobile computing.\n\nPeripheral Products\n\nThe   Company  sells  associated  computer  peripherals,  including   the\nImageWriter (registered trademark),  StyleWriter (registered trademark), \nColor StyleWriter and  LaserWriter (registered trademark)  printer\nfamilies, CD-ROM and magnetic disk drives, scanners and a range of  color\nand monochrome monitors.\n\nPersonal Digital-Assistant Products\n\nThe  Apple  MessagePad (trademark) 120 communications assistant  integrates  \nNewton (registered trademark) technology  in  a  hand-held  communications  \ndevice  that  intelligently assists the user in capturing, organizing and \ncommunicating information.\n\nOperating System Software and Application Software\n\nThe Company's operating system software, its proprietary Macintosh system\nsoftware called Mac OS, provides Apple computers with an easy, \nconsistent user  interface and built-in networking capability based on its \nAppleTalk networking standard, as well as other industry networking \nstandards,  and ensures  integration  of  hardware and software.   The  \nCompany's  system software business group also develops and distributes \nextensions  to  the Macintosh system software, such as utilities, languages,\ndeveloper tools, and  educational software.  Claris Corporation, a wholly \nowned subsidiary of the Company, develops, publishes, and distributes \napplication software in  a  variety of established personal productivity \ncategories,  such  as database   management  and  graphics,  for  Macintosh\nand  Windows-based systems.   Claris  also publishes and distributes software\ndeveloped  by independent developers through its Claris Clear Choice \n(trademark) labeling program. Claris  products  are distributed primarily\nthrough independent  software resellers.\n\nNetworking and Connectivity Products\n\nThe  Company  sells workgroup server  systems  that\nprovide   file,  print  and  communications  services  to  varying   size\nworkgroups.   The  Company  also provides networking  and  communications\nproducts  that  connect Apple systems to local area  networks,  providing\ninteroperability with other computers and computing environments as  well\nas  the  Internet.  These computing environments include IBM's large  and\nsmall systems and Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX, as well as systems\nconforming  to  the  Open System Interconnection (\"OSI\")  and  Transmission\nControl Protocol/Internet Protocol (\"TCP/IP\") standards.\n\nOn-Line Services\n\nThe  Company  is  moving forward on its new strategy of focusing  on  the\nInternet  to  deliver  online solutions for  customers  in  each  of  the\nCompany's  markets.  In doing so, eWorld (trademark), the Company's online  \nservice, plans to increasingly feature Internet content,\n\n                                        3\n##PAGE\n\nservices, and technology, along with a global electronic mail system with\nnews, information and other services.  This on-line service also includes\neWorld  for  Macintosh  and NewtonMail (registered trademark), eWorld's \nmessaging  service  for Newton.\n\nMarkets and Distribution\n\nThe  Company's  customers are primarily in the business,  education,  and\nconsumer markets.  Customers are attracted to the Macintosh in particular\nfor a variety of reasons, including the availability of a wide variety of\napplication software, the reduced amount of training resulting  from  the\nMacintosh's  intuitive ease of use, and the ability of the  Macintosh  to\nnetwork and communicate with other computer systems and environments.\n\nApple personal computers were first introduced to education customers  in\nthe  late 1970's.  In the United States, the Company is one of the  major\nsuppliers of personal computers for both elementary and secondary  school\ncustomers, as well as for college and university customers.  The  Company\nis  also  a  substantial  supplier to institutions  of  higher  education\noutside of the United States.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  the Company's formal commitment  to  serve  the\nfederal  government began in 1986 with the formation of the Apple Federal\nSystems Group.  Although the Company has contracts with a number of  U.S.\ngovernment  agencies, these contracts are not currently material  to  the\nCompany's overall financial condition or results of operations.\n\nPresently,  the  Americas  represent  the  Company's  largest  geographic\nmarketplace.   The Apple Americas organization focuses on  the  Company's\nsales,  marketing, and support efforts in the United States,  Canada  and\nLatin America.  Products sold in these regions are primarily manufactured\nin  the Company's facilities in California, Colorado, and Singapore,  and\ndistributed from facilities in California and Illinois.\n\nApproximately  45% to 48% of the Company's revenues in recent  years  has\ncome   from   its   international  operations.   The  Company   has   two\ninternational  sales  and marketing divisions, consisting  of  the  Apple\nEurope  division  and  the  Apple Pacific  division.   The  Apple  Europe\ndivision focuses on opportunities in Europe as well as in parts of Africa\nand  in  the  Middle  East.   Products sold by the  Europe  division  are\nmanufactured  primarily in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland.   The\nApple  Pacific  division  focuses on opportunities  in  Japan  and  Asia;\nAustralia  and New Zealand; and the Caribbean region.  Products  sold  by\nthe   Pacific  division  are  manufactured  primarily  in  the  Company's\nfacilities in California, Colorado and Singapore.\n\nThe   Company  distributes  its  products  through  third-party  computer\nresellers,  and  is also continuing its expansion into  various  consumer\nchannels,  such as mass merchandise stores, consumer electronics  outlets\nand  computer superstores, in response to changing industry practices and\ncustomer  preferences.   The Company's products  are  sold  primarily  to\nbusiness  and government customers through independent resellers,  value-\nadded  resellers  and  systems integrators;  to  home  customers  through\nindependent  resellers and consumer channels; and to education  customers\nthrough  direct  sales and independent resellers.  In  order  to  provide\nproducts and service to its independent resellers on a timely basis,  the\nCompany  distributes its products through a number of Apple  distribution\nand support centers.\n\nA  summary  of the Company's Industry Segment and Geographic  Information\nmay  be  found  in  Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under  the  heading\n\"Industry  Segment  and  Geographic Information\",  which  information  is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\n\nRaw materials\n\nAlthough  certain raw materials, processes, and components  essential  to\nthe Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, key\ncomponents  and processes currently obtained from single sources  include\ncertain  of  the  Company's  displays,  microprocessors,  mouse  devices,\nkeyboards,  disk  drives,  printers and printer components,  application-\nspecific  integrated  circuits (\"ASICs\")  and  other  custom  chips,  and\ncertain processes relating to construction of the plastic housing for the\nCompany's  computers.   Any  availability  limitations,  interruption  in\nsupplies, or price increases relative to these and other components could\nadversely  affect  the  Company's business  and  financial  results.   In\naddition, new products introduced by the Company often initially  utilize\ncustom  components obtained from only one source, until the  Company  has\nevaluated  whether  there  is  a need for  an  additional  supplier.   In\nsituations  where  a component or product utilizes new  technologies  and\nprocesses, there may be initial capacity  constraints until such time  as\nthe  suppliers'  yields  have  matured.   Materials  and  components  are\nnormally  acquired through purchase orders, as is common in the industry,\ntypically covering the Company's requirements for periods from 90 to  180\ndays.  However, the Company continues to evaluate the need for  a  supply\ncontract in each situation.\n\nIf  the supply of a key single-sourced material, process, or component to\nthe  Company  were to be delayed or curtailed, its ability  to  ship  the\nrelated product utilizing such material, process, or component in desired\nquantities  and  in  a  timely manner could be adversely  affected.   The\nCompany's  business  and financial performance could  also  be  adversely\naffected,  depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities\nfrom the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities\nfrom  an alternate source.  The Company believes that the suppliers whose\nloss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the\n\n                                        4\n##PAGE\n\nCompany's  business and financial position include, at this time,  Canon,\nInc.,  General  Electric Co., Hitachi, Ltd., IBM, Motorola,  Inc.,  Sharp\nCorporation,  Sony  Corporation, Texas Instruments,  Inc.,  and/or  their\nUnited States affiliates, and VLSI Technology, Inc.  However, the Company\nhelps  mitigate these potential risks by working closely with  these  and\nother key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories,\nand coordinated product introductions.  The Company believes that most of\nits  single-source suppliers, including most of the foregoing  companies,\nare   reliable  multinational  corporations.   Most  of  these  suppliers\nmanufacture the relevant materials, processes, or components in  multiple\nplants.   The  Company  further believes that its long-standing  business\nrelationships with these and other key suppliers are strong and  mutually\nbeneficial in nature.\n\nThe  Company  has  also from time to time experienced  significant  price\nincreases  and  limited  availability  of  certain  components  that  are\navailable  from multiple sources.  Any similar occurrences in the  future\ncould have an adverse affect on the Company's operating results.\n\nThe  Company  has  a  supply agreement with Motorola, Inc.  (see  Exhibit\n10.B.12  hereto).  The agreement with Motorola continues for  five  years\nfrom January 31, 1992 unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by  the\nparties.    The  Company  single-sources  certain  microprocessors   from\nMotorola.  The  supply agreement does not obligate the  Company  to  make\nminimum  purchase  commitments; however, the agreement  does  commit  the\nvendor  to supply the Company's requirements of the particular items  for\nthe duration of the agreement.\n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components  may\nbe  found  under  Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the  subheading\n\"Inventory  and  Supply\"  included under the heading  \"Factors  That  May\nAffect  Future  Results and Financial Condition,\"  which  information  is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\n\nPatents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses\n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating  to\ncertain aspects of its computer and peripheral systems.  In addition, the\nCompany has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the\nUnited  States and a number of foreign countries for \"Apple\",  the  Apple\nsilhouette  logo, the Apple color logo, \"Macintosh\", Newton,  the  Newton\nLightbulb  logo,  and  numerous other product trademarks.  In  1986,  the\nCompany  acquired  ownership  of the trademark  \"Macintosh\"  for  use  in\nconnection  with computer products.  Although the Company  believes  that\nthe ownership of such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important\nfactor  in its business and that its success does depend in part  on  the\nownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills,\ntechnical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nBecause  of  technological  changes in  the  computer  industry,  current\nextensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents,\nit  is  possible  that certain components of the Company's  products  may\nunknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company believes the\nresolution  of  any  claim of infringements would  not  have  a  material\nadverse  effect on its financial condition and results of  operations  as\nreported in the accompanying financial statements.  However, depending on\nthe amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of any such claims  of\ninfringement,  it  is  possible  that the  Company's  future  results  of\noperations  or  cash flow could be materially affected  in  a  particular\nperiod.   The  Company has from time to time entered into cross-licensing\nagreements with other companies.\n\nSeasonal business\n\nAlthough  the  Company  does  not consider  its  business  to  be  highly\nseasonal,  it has historically experienced increased sales in  its  first\nand  fourth  fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters  in  its  fiscal\nyear,  due to holiday demand for and calendar year-end buying of some  of\nits  products.   However, past performance should  not  be  considered  a\nreliable   indicator  of  the  Company's  future  revenue  or   financial\nperformance.\n\nWarranty\n\nThe  Company  offers a parts and labor limited warranty on its  products.\nThe  warranty  period is one year from the date of purchase  by  the  end\nuser.   The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple service parts\nused  to  repair  Apple  hardware products.  In addition,  consumers  may\npurchase extended service coverage on all Apple hardware products.\n\nCustomers\n\nNo customer of the Company accounted for 10% or more of net sales in each\nof the fiscal years 1995, 1994, and 1993.\n\nBacklog\n\nIn general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-\nneeded basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery\n\n                                        5\n##PAGE\n\nschedules  and  order  rates  depending on  changing  market  conditions.\nUnfilled  orders (backlog) can be, and often are, canceled at will.   The\nCompany  attempts  to  fill orders on the requested  delivery  schedules.\nHowever,  products may be in relatively short supply from  time  to  time\nuntil  production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet  demand\nor  if other production or fulfillment  constraints exist.  The Company's\nbacklog  of  unfilled  orders decreased slightly  to  approximately  $618\nmillion  at December 1, 1995 from $663 million at December 2, 1994.   The\nCompany's  backlog at December 1, 1995 consists primarily of its  higher-\nend Power Macintosh products.  The Company expects that substantially all\nof  its  orders in backlog at December 1, 1995 will be either shipped  or\ncanceled during fiscal 1996.\n\nIn  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business\nprospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of  or\nimmediately  following  introduction of new  products  because  of  over-\nordering  by  dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often  is  reduced\nonce  dealers  and  customers believe they can obtain sufficient  supply.\nBecause  of  the  foregoing,  as  well as  other  factors  affecting  the\nCompany's  backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator\nof  the  Company's  future  revenue or  financial  performance.   Further\ninformation regarding the Company's backlog may be found under  Part  II,\nItem  7  of  this Annual Report on Form 10-K under  the\nsubheading  \"Product Introductions and Transitions\"  included  under  the\nheading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe  market  for the design, manufacture and sale of personal  computers,\npersonal digital assistants, and related software and peripheral products\nis  highly  competitive.   It  continues to  be  characterized  by  rapid\ntechnological  advances  in both hardware and software  development  that\nhave  substantially increased the capabilities and applications of  these\nproducts,  and has resulted in the frequent introduction of new products.\nThe   principal   competitive  factors  in  this  market   are   relative\nprice/performance,  product  quality  and  reliability,  availability  of\nsoftware,   product  features,  marketing  and  distribution  capability,\nservice  and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate\nreputation.\n\nFurther discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal\ncomputing  industry and the Company's competitive position in the  market\nplace  may  be  found under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K  under  the\nsubheading  \"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors  That  May\nAffect  Future  Results and Financial Condition,\"  which  information  is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\n\nResearch and development\n\nBecause  the  personal  computer  industry  is  characterized  by   rapid\ntechnological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully  is\nheavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow\nof  competitive  products to the marketplace.  The Company  continues  to\ndevelop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in\nthe  areas  of hardware and peripherals, system software, and  networking\nand  communications. The Company's research and development  expenditures\ntotaled  $614  million, $564 million,  and $665 million, in fiscal  years\n1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.\n\nFurther  information regarding the Company's R&D expenditures for  fiscal\nyear  1995  is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K  under  the\nheading \"Operating Expenses,\" which information is hereby incorporated by\nreference.\n\nEnvironmental laws\n\nCompliance with United States federal, state, and local laws enacted  for\nthe protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon\nthe  Company's  capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive  position.\nAlthough the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects  in\nthe  future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of  such\nlaws,  no  assurance  can be given that such laws,  or  any  future  laws\nenacted  for the protection of the environment, will not have a  material\nadverse effect on the Company.\n\nEmployees\n\nAt  September 29, 1995, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide  had  13,191\nregular  employees,  and  an  additional  4,424  temporary  or  part-time\ncontractors and employees.\n\nForeign and domestic operations and geographic data\n\nInformation  regarding financial data by geographic area  and  the  risks\nassociated with international operations is set forth under Part II, Item\n8  of  this  Form 10-K under the heading \"Industry Segment and Geographic\nInformation\",  and  under Part II, Item 7 of this  Form  10-K  under  the\nsubheading  \"Global  Market Risks,\" included under the  heading  \"Factors\nThat   May   Affect  Future  Results  and  Financial  Condition,\"   which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n                                        6\n##PAGE\n\nMargins  on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on domestic\nsales   of  products  that  include  components  obtained  from   foreign\nsuppliers,  can be adversely affected by foreign currency  exchange  rate\nfluctuations  and  by international trade regulations, including  tariffs\nand anti-dumping penalties.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.

The  net  sales\ngrowth  in  1995  over  1994 was primarily due to a combination  of  unit\ngrowth,  higher average selling prices, and changes in currency  exchange\nrates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased approximately  15%\nover  the  prior year.  This unit sales growth resulted principally  from\nstrong  sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products, which accounted\nfor over 70% of total unit shipments at the end of the fourth quarter  of\n1995,  compared with 26% in the comparable period of 1994, and from sales\nof  newer  product  offerings  within the  Performa  family  of  desktop\npersonal  computers.  This unit growth was partially offset by  declining\nunit  sales  of  certain of the Company's older product  offerings.   The\naverage  aggregate  revenue  per Macintosh unit  increased  12%  in  1995\ncompared  with 1994, primarily due to a shift in product mix  toward  the\nCompany's newer products and products with multimedia configurations.\n\nThe  net sales growth in 1994 over 1993 was primarily due to two factors:\nunit  sales  growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in  the  average\naggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  Total Macintosh  computer\nunit  sales  increased  16% over the prior year.   This  growth  resulted\nprincipally  from  strong  sales  of the Company's  new  Power  Macintosh\nproducts  and  of  newer product offerings within the Macintosh  Performa\nfamily of desktop personal computers and, to a lesser extent, from  sales\nof  products within the PowerBook family of notebook personal computers.\nThis  growth was partially offset by declining unit sales in  certain  of\nthe  Company's more established products and older product versions.  The\naverage   aggregate  revenue  per  Macintosh  unit  increased   slightly,\nprimarily due to fluctuations in product mix throughout the year, despite\npricing  actions  undertaken by the Company  in  response  to  continuing\nindustrywide pricing pressures.\n\nInternational net sales grew 25% from 1994 to 1995, primarily  reflecting\nstrong  net  sales growth in the Pacific region, particularly Japan,  and\nfavorable  changes in currency exchange rates.  Net sales grew moderately\nin  Europe over the same period.  International net sales grew  17%  from\n1993 to 1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific\nregion, particularly Japan.  International net sales represented  48%  of\nnet  sales in 1995 compared with 46% of net sales in 1994 and 45% of  net\nsales in 1993.  Domestic net sales grew 16% over the prior year, compared\nwith  an  increase  of  14% in 1994 over 1993, primarily  resulting  from\nstrong growth in the education and consumer markets.\n\nIn general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as-\nneeded  basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and  order\nrates   depending   on  changing  market  conditions.   Unfilled   orders\n(\"backlog\")  can  be,  and  often are, canceled  at  will.   The  Company\nattempts  to  fill orders on the requested delivery schedules.   However,\nproducts  may  be  in  relatively short supply from time  to  time  until\nproduction volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand  or  if\nother production or fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog\nwas  approximately $618 million at December 1, 1995, consisting primarily\nof the Company's higher-end Power Macintosh products.\n\n                                       10\n##PAGE\n\nIn  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business\nprospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of  or\nimmediately   following   introduction  of  new   products   because   of\noverordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced\nonce  dealers  and  customers believe they can obtain sufficient  supply.\nBecause  of  the  foregoing,  as  well as  other  factors  affecting  the\nCompany's  backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator\nof  the  Company's future revenue or financial performance.  For  further\ninformation  regarding  the  Company's  backlog,  refer  to  page  13  of\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results\nof  Operations under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future  Results\nand Financial Condition.\"\n\nGross Margin\n\nGross  margin represents the difference between the Company's  net  sales\nand  its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale\nof products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for\nits products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is\nbased primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct\nlabor  costs.   The  type and cost of components included  in  particular\nconfigurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk drives)\nare   often   directly  related  to  the  need  to  market  products   in\nconfigurations   competitive   with   those   of   other   manufacturers.\nCompetition  in  the personal computer industry is intense,  and  in  the\nshort  term,  frequent changes in pricing and product  configuration  are\noften  necessary  in  order  to remain competitive.   Accordingly,  gross\nmargin  as  a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced  in\nthe  short  term  by  actions undertaken by the Company  in  response  to\nindustrywide competitive pressures.\n\nGross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in\n1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of\nnet  sales  was primarily a result of a shift in product mix  toward  the\nCompany's  newer, high-margin products, which included  strong  sales  of\ncertain  products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of personal\ncomputers and its entry-level Macintosh Performa family.\n\nThe increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes  in\nforeign  currency  exchange rates as a result of  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar\nrelative to certain foreign currencies  in 1995 compared with 1994.   The\nCompany's  operating strategy and pricing take into  account  changes  in\nexchange  rates over time; however, the Company's results  of  operations\ncan  be  significantly  affected in the short  term  by  fluctuations  in\nforeign currency exchange rates.\n\nGross  margin  in  1994 declined as a percentage of net sales  from  1993\nlevels.  The downward trend in gross margin as a percentage of net  sales\nwas  primarily a result of pricing and promotional actions undertaken  by\nthe  Company  in response to industrywide competitive pricing  pressures.\nGross  margin was also affected somewhat adversely by changes in  foreign\ncurrency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to\ncertain foreign currencies in 1994 compared with 1993.  Results from  the\nCompany's ongoing foreign currency hedging activities offset a portion of\nthis adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin.\n\nAlthough  the Company's gross margin percentage was 25.8% in 1995,  gross\nmargin  as  a  percentage of net sales declined to 20.7%  in  the  fourth\nquarter  of 1995, primarily due to aggressive pricing actions and product\nmix  issues  related to component availability and delays in new  PowerPC\nprocessor-based product production.  It is anticipated that gross margins\nwill  continue  to remain under significant pressure and  are  likely  to\nremain  comparable to the level reported for the fourth quarter  of  1995\ndue  to  a  variety of factors, including continued industrywide  pricing\npressures,  increased competition, particularly in Japan, and  compressed\nproduct life cycles.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch  and  development expenditures increased in amount  during  1995\nwhen  compared with 1994, primarily due to higher project- and headcount-\nrelated  spending, as the Company continues to invest in the  development\nof   new  products  and  technologies.   The  decrease  in  research  and\ndevelopment  expenditures during 1994 compared with  1993  reflected  the\nresults  of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs,\nincluding  product  development expenditures.  Research  and  development\nexpenditures  as  a  percentage of net sales have continued  to  decrease\nsince  1993  as a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995,  coupled\nwith  the  Company's  continuing  efforts  to  focus  its  research   and\ndevelopment project spending in an efficient manner.\n\nThe  Company  believes that continued focused investment in research  and\ndevelopment is critical to its future growth and competitive position  in\nthe marketplace, and is directly related to continued, timely development\nof new and enhanced products.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling,  general and administrative expenses increased  in  amount,  but\ndecreased as a percentage of net sales, in 1995 compared with 1994.  This\nincrease  in expense was primarily a result of increased advertising  and\nchannel  marketing program spending as the Company continued its  efforts\nto  expand  its  market share.  Although the Company  has  increased  its\nselling  and marketing expenses in an effort to expand its market  share,\nthere  can be no assurance that such an increase in spending will  result\nin a corresponding\n\n                                       11\n##PAGE\n\nincrease  in  market share.  The decrease as a percentage  of  net  sales\nsince  1993 is primarily a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995,\ncombined  with  the Company's ongoing efforts to manage  total  operating\nexpense growth.\n\nIn 1994, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount\nand as a percentage of net sales compared with 1993, primarily because of\nlower   employee-related  and  facilities  costs   resulting   from   the\nrestructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 1993.  Revenue growth\nin  1994  also  contributed  to  the decrease  in  selling,  general  and\nadministrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.\n\nThe  Company  will continue to face the challenge of managing  growth  in\nselling,  general and administrative expenses relative  to  gross  margin\nlevels,  particularly in light of the Company's expectation of  continued\npressure on gross margins and continued competitive pressures worldwide.\n\nRestructuring Costs\n\nFor  information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, refer  to\npages 29 - 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nInterest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased to $10  million  in\nexpense  in  1995 from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12  million\nfavorable change is comprised of $48 million in interest and other income\nattributable to higher average cash balances, higher interest rates,  and\ninterest  rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36 million unfavorable\nvariance  related  to  realized and unrealized foreign  exchange  hedging\nlosses  and foreign exchange hedging costs.  Market volatility and higher\nforeign currency balances account for the increased hedging cost.\n\nIn  1994,  interest  and other income (expense), net,  decreased  to  $22\nmillion in expense from $30 million of income in 1993, resulting in a $52\nmillion  unfavorable change.  Higher interest rates  and  larger  average\nborrowing  balances  used  to  fund  working  capital  needs  served   to\nsignificantly increase interest expense, and accounted for $28 million of\nthe  $52 million change during 1994.  Other factors contributing to  this\nvariance included interest income, which was higher in 1993 than in  1994\nprimarily  due  to  a  $15  million  interest  payment  received   on   a\nnonrecurring income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service in 1993,\nand  interest  income  from the Company's interest rate  risk  management\nprogram,  which  contributed  $6 million in 1993,  and  reduced  interest\nincome by $7 million in 1994.\n\nFor more information regarding the Company's strategy and accounting for\nfinancial and other derivative instruments, refer to pages 26 -  28 of\nthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes            1995   Change  1994   Change  1993\n                                                                          \nProvision for income taxes          $  250     32%  $ 190    258%   $ 53\nEffective tax rate                     37%            38%            38%\n\nThe Company's effective tax rate decreased to 37% in 1995 compared with a\nrate  of  38%  in  1994  and 1993.  For additional information  regarding\nincome  taxes,  refer  to  pages 31 - 32 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\n\nThe  Company's  future  operating results  and  financial  condition  are\ndependent  on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture,\nand  market technologically innovative products in order to meet  dynamic\ncustomer  demand  patterns.  Inherent in this process  are  a  number  of\nfactors  that  the Company must successfully manage in order  to  achieve\nfavorable future operating results and financial condition.\n\nProduct Introductions and Transitions\n\nDue  to  the  highly  volatile nature of the personal computer  industry,\nwhich  is  characterized by dynamic customer demand  patterns  and  rapid\ntechnological  advances, the Company frequently introduces  new  products\nand  product  enhancements.  The success of new product introductions  is\ndependent  on  a  number  of factors, including  market  acceptance,  the\nCompany's   ability   to  manage  the  risks  associated   with   product\ntransitions,  the availability of application software for new  products,\nthe  effective  management of inventory levels in line  with  anticipated\nproduct   demand,  and  the  manufacturing  of  products  in  appropriate\nquantities  to meet anticipated demand.  Accordingly, the Company  cannot\ndetermine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or\nresults of operations.\n\n                                       12\n##PAGE\n\nIn  1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of Macintosh\ncomputers  based  on  a new PowerPC family of RISC microprocessors.   The\nCompany's  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely\naffected if it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its\nlines of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series of\nmicroprocessors  to  the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  success  of  this\nongoing  transition will depend on the Company's ability to  continue  to\nsell products based on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors while\ncontinuing  to  gain market acceptance of the new PowerPC processor-based\nproducts,  to successfully manage inventory levels of both product  lines\nsimultaneously, and to continue to coordinate the timely development  and\ndistribution  by  independent software vendors of new  \"native\"  software\napplications   specifically  designed  for  the  PowerPC  processor-based\nproducts.\n\nThe rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new\nproduct  is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments\nfor  that product, which depends on many factors, some of which  are  not\nunder  the  control  of the Company.  These factors may  include  initial\nlarge  purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends  to\npurchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users\n(\"early adopters\"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by  users\nwho  anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of\nother products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages  due\nto the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other\nfactors,  such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many  users  until  new\ntechnology  is accepted as \"proven\" and for which commonly used  software\nproducts are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once  they\nbelieve  they  can  obtain  sufficient supply of  product  previously  in\nbacklog.\n\nBacklog  is  often volatile after new product introductions  due  to  the\naforementioned   demand   factors,  often  increasing   coincident   with\nintroduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they\ncan obtain sufficient supply of product.\n\nThe  measurement  of  demand  for newly introduced  products  is  further\ncomplicated  by  the  availability of different  product  configurations,\nwhich  may  include various types of built-in peripherals  and  software.\nConfigurations may also require certain localization (such  as  language)\nfor  various  markets  and, as a result, demand in  different  geographic\nareas  may  be a function of the availability of third-party software  in\nthose  localized  versions.  For example, the availability  of  European-\nlanguage versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may\nlag  behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more.  This\nmay result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside\nthe  United  States,  even  though localized versions  of  the  Company's\nproducts may be available.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues to  be\ncharacterized by consolidations in the hardware and software  industries,\naggressive  pricing practices, and downward pressure  on  gross  margins.\nFor  example,  in  Japan, other companies have begun to initiate  extreme\ncompetitive  actions in order to gain market share, and as a result,  the\nCompany  has  implemented incremental pricing and promotional activities.\nThe  Company's  results of operations and financial  condition  could  be\nadversely affected should the Company be unable to effectively manage the\nimpact of industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on  gross\nmargins.\n\nThe  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also\nbe  affected  by  the  Company's ability to offer  customers  competitive\ntechnologies  while effectively managing the impact on  inventory  levels\nand   the   potential   for  customer  confusion   created   by   product\nproliferation.   The  Company's future operating  results  and  financial\ncondition  may also be affected by overall demand for personal  computers\nand general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set\nof product features over another.\n\nOn  November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with IBM and \nMotorola, Inc. on a new hardware reference  platform for the PowerPC \nmicroprocessor that  is  intended  to deliver  a  much wider range of \noperating system and application  choices for  computer customers.  As a \nresult of this agreement, the  Company  is moving  forward  with its efforts \nto make the Macintosh operating  system available on the common platform.  \nIn line with its efforts, on  November 13, 1995, the Company, IBM, and \nMotorola, Inc. announced the availability of  the \"PowerPC Platform,\" which \nis a set of specifications that defines a  \"unified\"  personal  computer  \narchitecture  and  combines  the  Power Macintosh  platform and the PC \nenvironment.  Accordingly,  the  Company's future  operating results and \nfinancial condition may be affected by  its ability  to  continue  to  \nimplement this  agreement  and  certain  other collaboration agreements, \nand to manage the associated competitive risk.\n\nThe  Company  is currently the primary maker of hardware  that  uses  the\nMacintosh  operating system, and it has a minority market  share  in  the\npersonal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers  that\nrun  the MS-DOS (registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows (trademark) \noperating systems.  The Company's future  operating results and financial \ncondition may be affected by  its ability  to increase market share in its \npersonal computer business.   As part  of  its  efforts  to  increase \noverall market  share,  the  Company announced  the  licensing  of the \nMacintosh  operating  system  to  other personal  computer vendors in \nJanuary 1995, and several vendors currently sell product that utilize the \nMacintosh operating system.  The success of the  Company's  efforts  to  \nincrease its overall  market  share  through licensing  of the Macintosh \noperating system will depend in part  on  the Company's  ability  to manage \nthe risks associated  with  competing  with companies producing Macintosh \nOS-based computer systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot determine\n\n                                       13\n##PAGE\n\nthe  ultimate  effect  that licensing  of  the Macintosh operating system \nwill have  on  its  product pricing  and  unit  sales  or  future  operating \nresults  and  financial condition.  The Company believes that licensing the \noperating system will result  in a broader installed base on which software \nvendors can develop and  provide technical innovations for the Macintosh \nplatform.   However, there  can  be no assurance that the installed base \nwill be broadened  by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing\nwill result in an increase  in  the number of application software titles or \nthe  rate  at which  vendors  will bring to market application software  \nbased  on  the Macintosh operating system.\n\nThe   Company's  principal  competitor  in  producing  operating   system\nsoftware,  Microsoft  Corporation, is a large, well-financed  corporation\nwhich  has  a  dominant  position in various  segments  of  the  personal\ncomputer  software  industry.   In  August  1995,  Microsoft  Corporation\nreleased  Windows 95, another of its operating system  offerings.   As  a\nresult of the introduction of Windows 95, the Company has taken and  will\ncontinue  to  take  steps  to address the additional  challenges  to  and\ncompetitive  pressures  on its efforts in developing  and  marketing  the\nCompany's products.  Accordingly, the Company's future operating  results\nand financial condition could be adversely affected should the Company be\nunable   to  effectively  manage  the  competitive  pressure  and   other\nchallenges presented by the introduction of Windows 95.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's personal computer  products  are  capable  of\nrunning application software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating\nsystems (\"Cross-Platform Products\"), through software emulation of  Intel\nCorporation microprocessor chips by use of software specifically designed\nfor  the  Company's  products, either those based on the  Motorola  68000\nseries  of  microprocessors or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor.\nThe  Company  has also introduced products that include both  the  RISC-\nbased  PowerPC 601 microprocessor and the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor, which\nenable  users  to  switch between the Macintosh and DOS or Windows  computing\nenvironments.\n\nThe  Company  currently  supplies customers who  purchase  Cross-Platform\nProducts  capable of running the MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 operating system with\noperating  system  software under a licensing agreement  with  Microsoft.\nThis  license  agreement expires on December 31, 1995 (the  \"Old  License\nAgreement\").   The Company has attempted to license Windows  95  software\nfrom  Microsoft  but has been unable to do so because  of  the  Company's\nunwillingness to consent to Microsoft's demand under Microsoft's proposed\nlicense  agreement (the \"New License Agreement\") that the  Company  agree\nnot to sue Microsoft if Microsoft infringes any of the Company's patents.\nMicrosoft  has also informed the Company that it will not renew  the  Old\nLicense  Agreement unless the Company accepts the New License  Agreement.\nAccordingly,  unless an appropriate licensing agreement is reached,  upon\nthe  expiration of the Old License Agreement, the Company will be  unable\nto  supply customers with any of Microsoft's operating systems on  Cross-\nPlatform  Products.   Although  customers could  obtain  copies  of  such\nsoftware from other sources, the Company is unable to predict the  effect\nof  such a situation on the demand for Cross-Platform Products.  Although\nCross-Platform Products represented only a small portion of the Company's\nunit  sales during 1995, the Company is unable to predict the  effect  of\nsuch a situation on the Company's future operating results.\n\nDecisions  by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers,  as\nopposed  to  MS-DOS  or Windows-based systems, are  often  based  on  the\navailability  of  third-party software for particular applications.   The\nCompany   believes  that  the  availability  of  third-party  application\nsoftware for the Company's hardware products depends in part on the third-\nparty  developers'  perception and analysis of the relative  benefits  of\ndeveloping  such software for the Company's products versus software  for\nthe  larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors\nsuch  as  the  relative  market  share of  the  Company's  products,  the\nanticipated  potential  revenue that may be  earned,  and  the  costs  of\ndeveloping such software products.  Microsoft Corporation is an important\ndeveloper   of   application  software  for   the   Company's   products.\nAccordingly,  Microsoft's interest in producing application software  for\nthe Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its\ninterests as an operating system vendor.\n\nThe  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also\ndependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of  the\nPowerPC  RISC  microprocessor for certain of the Company's  products,  to\ncontinue  to supply to the Company microprocessors that produce  superior\nprice/performance results compared with those supplied to  the  Company's\ncompetitors  by  Intel Corporation, the developer  and  producer  of  the\nmicroprocessors  used  by most personal computers using  the  MS-DOS  and\nWindows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  the\nIntel  microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor,  and  is\nalso the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's\nMacintosh operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the\nCompany  with  improved  versions of microprocessors  for  the  Company's\nproducts  may  be influenced by IBM's perception of its  interests  as  a\ncompeting manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating\nsystem vendor.\n\nThe  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also\nbe   affected  by  the  Company's  ability  to  successfully  expand  and\ncapitalize  on its investments in other markets, such as the markets  for\nInternet services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.\n\n\n\n\n                                       14\n##PAGE\n\nGlobal Market Risks\n\nA   large   portion  of  the  Company's  revenue  is  derived  from   its\ninternational  operations.   As a result, the  Company's  operations  and\nfinancial  results  could  be  significantly  affected  by  international\nfactors,  such  as  changes in foreign currency exchange  rates  or  weak\neconomic  conditions  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  the   Company\ndistributes its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other\ncurrencies,  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  non-U.S.  dollar-based   sales\ndecreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value  of  non-\nU.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value\nof non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and\ndecreases  when the U.S. dollar strengthens.  Overall, the Company  is  a\nnet  receiver  of  currencies other than the U.S. dollar  and,  as  such,\nbenefits  from  a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by  a  stronger\ndollar  relative to major currencies worldwide.  Accordingly, changes  in\nexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may\nnegatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins  (as\nexpressed in U.S. dollars).\n\nTo  mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates\non  the  Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement,  and\noperating  expenses,  the Company regularly hedges its  non-U.S.  dollar-\nbased  exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange\nforward  and  option  contracts to hedge firmly  committed  transactions.\nCurrently,  hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend  beyond\none  year.   The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts\nto  hedge  certain other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.\nHedges  of  probable, but not firmly committed transactions currently  do\nnot  extend  beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with  these\nongoing  foreign  exchange hedging programs, the Company  also  regularly\nsells  foreign  exchange option contracts and enters into  certain  other\nforeign  exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and  option\ncontracts  not  accounted  for  as  hedges,  including  all  transactions\nintended  to  reduce  the  costs associated with  the  Company's  foreign\nexchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted  on\neach  balance  sheet date for changes in exchange rates.   Refer  to  the\nFinancial  Instruments  footnote on  pages  26  -  28  of  the  Notes  to\nConsolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nWhile the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest\nrates  of  many  of  the  world's leading industrialized  countries,  the\nCompany's  interest income and expense is most sensitive to  fluctuations\nin  the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in\nU.S.  interest  rates affect the interest earned on the  Company's  cash,\ncash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid  on\nits short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact  of\nfluctuations  in  U.S.  interest rates,  the  Company  has  entered  into\ninterest  rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps  are\nintended  to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income  on\nits  cash,  cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the  fixed-\nrate  interest  expense on its long-term debt.  The Company  also  enters\ninto  interest rate swap and option transactions in order to diversify  a\nportion  of  the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in  short-term\nU.S.  interest  rates.  These instruments may extend the  Company's  cash\ninvestment horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.\n\nTo  ensure  the  adequacy  and effectiveness  of  the  Company's  foreign\nexchange  and  interest rate hedge positions, as well as to  monitor  the\nrisks   and  opportunities  of  the  nonhedge  portfolios,  the   Company\ncontinually  monitors its foreign exchange forward and option  positions,\nand  its  interest rate swap and option positions on a stand-alone  basis\nand  in  conjunction with its underlying foreign currency-  and  interest\nrate-related  exposures, respectively, from both  an  accounting  and  an\neconomic  perspective.   However, given the  effective  horizons  of  the\nCompany's risk management activities, there can be no assurance that  the\naforementioned  programs will offset more than a portion of  the  adverse\nfinancial  impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either  foreign\nexchange  or  interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the  accounting\nfor recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments\nfor any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses\nrelated  to the underlying economic exposures, and as such, may adversely\naffect  the  Company's  operating results and  financial  position.   The\nCompany generally does not engage in leveraged hedging.\n\nInventory and Supply\n\nThe  Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be  limited\nby  the  availability of key components.  The Company believes  that  the\navailability  from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer  industry   of\nmicroprocessors  and  ASICs presents the most significant  potential  for\nconstraining  the  Company's  ability  to  produce  products.    Specific\nmicroprocessors  manufactured by Motorola, Inc.  and  IBM  are  currently\navailable  only  from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors\nare currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and thus have\nlimited  availability.  The Company and other producers in  the  personal\ncomputer  industry  also  compete for other semiconductor  products  with\nother  industries  that  have  experienced  increased  demand  for   such\nproducts,  due  to either increased consumer demand or increased  use  of\nsemiconductors  in  their  products  (such  as  the  cellular  phone  and\nautomotive  industries).  Finally, the Company uses some components  that\nare  not  common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including\ncertain  ASICs).   Continued  availability of  these  components  may  be\naffected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production  of\ncommon  components  instead of custom components.   Such  product  supply\nconstraints and corresponding increased costs could adversely affect  the\nCompany's  future  operating results and financial  condition,  including\nloss of market share.\n\n\n                                       15\n##PAGE\n\nThe  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also\nbe adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels\nand  lead  times  required  to obtain components  in  order  to  be  more\nresponsive  to  short-term  shifts  in  customer  demand  patterns.    In\naddition,  if  anticipated unit sales growth for new and current  product\nofferings  is  not  realized, the Company's  results  of  operations  and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nMarketing and Distribution\n\nA  number  of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution  of\nthe  Company's  products.   Currently, the  Company's  primary  means  of\ndistribution  is  through third-party computer resellers.   However,  the\nCompany is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels,  such\nas  mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics outlets,  and  computer\nsuperstores.   The  Company's  business and financial  results  could  be\nadversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers  weakens\nor  if  resellers  within consumer channels decide  not  to  continue  to\ndistribute the Company's products.\n\nOther Factors\n\nThe  majority  of the Company's research and development activities,  its\ncorporate  headquarters,  and  other  critical  business  operations  are\nlocated  near major seismic faults. The Company's operating  results  and\nfinancial  condition could be materially adversely affected in the  event\nof a major earthquake.\n\nThe  Company  is  currently  in  the process  of  replacing  its  current\ntransaction   systems  (which  include  order  management,  distribution,\nmanufacturing, and finance) with a single integrated system  as  part  of\nits  ongoing  effort to increase operational efficiency.   The  Company's\nfuture  operating  results  and financial condition  could  be  adversely\naffected  if  it  is  unable  to implement  and  effectively  manage  the\ntransition to this new integrated system.\n\nIn  April  1995,  the  Company  announced  a  companywide  reorganization\ndesigned  to  more  closely align the Company's organizational  structure\nwith  the  Company's  business strategy of  placing  increased  focus  on\ncustomer  needs  and expanding its presence in the home,  education,  and\nbusiness  markets.   In November 1995, the Company  announced  a  further\ncompanywide reorganization to accelerate the implementation of its market\nsegmentation strategy.  The Company's reorganization will result  in  the\nconsolidation   of   its   sales,  marketing,  and   customer   solutions\norganization  into three geographic business units, namely, the  Americas,\nEurope,  and Japan and Asia.  The Company's future operating results  and\nfinancial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  by  its  ability  to\neffectively manage the transition to these new organizational structures.\nAlthough  it  is  uncertain at this time, the Company  may  incur  future\nrestructuring charges as a result of these reorganizations.\n\nHistorically, the Company has experienced increased sales  in  its  first\nand  fourth fiscal quarters due to holiday demand for and calendar  year-\nend  buying  of  some  of its products.  As of the date  of  this  Annual\nReport,  published  reports  relating to the  U.S.  economy  indicated  a\npotentially  unfavorable year-end buying season.   Any  general  economic\nslowdown could adversely affect demand for the Company's products,  which\ncould  adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nBecause of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the\nCompany's  operating  results  and financial  condition,  past  financial\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate\nresults  or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the  Company's\nparticipation  in a highly dynamic industry often results in  significant\nvolatility of the Company's common stock price.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe  Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents,\nand  short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings,  decreased  to\n$491  million  at September 29, 1995, from $966 million at September  30,\n1994.\n\nLess  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1995  compared  with  1994,\nprimarily  as a result of growth in inventory levels and an  increase  in\naccounts  receivable.   Inventory levels grew during  1995  in  order  to\nsupport anticipated demand in the first quarter of 1996 for the Company's\nnew  products.  Accounts receivable also increased, reflecting the higher\nsales levels achieved during 1995, primarily toward the end of the fourth\nquarter.\n\nCash  used  for operations in 1995 was partially offset by cash generated\nfrom  higher  sales  and accounts payable levels.   The  increased  sales\nlevels  were driven by aggressive pricing and promotional actions coupled\nwith  strong  demand for the Company's PowerPC processor-based  products.\nAccounts  payable  increased as a result of the growth in  inventory  and\nproduction levels and longer payment terms negotiated with vendors.\n\nMore  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1994  compared  with  1993,\nprimarily due to a significant decrease in inventory levels, as  well  as\nincreased  sales  levels.  The significant decrease in  inventory  levels\nduring 1994 resulted from improved inventory\n\n                                       16\n##PAGE\n\nmanagement, higher 1994 sales levels attributable to various pricing  and\npromotional actions, and strong sales of new product inventory which  had\nbeen  built  up  in preparation for the introduction of Power  Macintosh.\nProfit  levels  improved  as  operating expenses  decreased  due  to  the\nCompany's implementation of restructuring actions initiated in the  third\nquarter of 1993.\n\nCash  generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset by  cash  used\nfor  restructuring and an increase in accounts receivable.  The  increase\nin  accounts  receivable reflected an increase in sales  levels  achieved\nduring 1994.  The balance of accrued restructuring costs decreased as the\nrestructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993 continued to\nbe  implemented.  In addition, in the third quarter of 1994, the  Company\nlowered  its estimate of the costs associated with the restructuring  and\nrecorded  an  adjustment  that  increased income  by  $127  million  ($79\nmillion,  or  $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment  primarily\nreflected  the  modification or cancelation of certain  elements  of  the\nCompany's  original restructuring plan because of changing  business  and\neconomic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring  plan\nfinancially less attractive than originally anticipated.\n\nExcluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments increased\nin  1995  compared  with 1994 and 1993 levels.  Net  cash  used  for  the\npurchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $159 million in  1995,\nand  was  primarily made up of increases in manufacturing  machinery  and\nequipment.   The  Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1996\nwill remain relatively consistent with 1995 expenditure levels.\n\nThe  Company  leases the majority of its facilities and  certain  of  its\nequipment  under noncancelable operating leases.  In 1995,  rent  expense\nunder all operating leases was approximately $127 million.  The Company's\nfuture  lease  commitments are discussed on  page  34  of  the  Notes  to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n\nShort-term  borrowings  at September 29, 1995,  were  approximately  $169\nmillion  higher  than  at  September  30,  1994.  These  borrowings  were\nprimarily made to fund expected working capital growth in certain markets\nworldwide.   In  general,  the  Company's short-term  borrowings  reflect\nborrowings  made under its commercial paper program and short-term  loans\nfrom  certain  commercial banks.  In particular, Apple  Japan,  Inc.  and\nApple Computer BV (Netherlands), subsidiaries of the Company, held short-\nterm  borrowings from several banks, totaling approximately $199  million\nand $262 million, respectively, at September 29, 1995.\n\nThe  Company's  balance  of long-term debt remained  relatively  constant\nduring  1995.  In 1994, $300 million aggregate principal amount  of  6.5%\nunsecured notes were issued under an omnibus shelf registration statement\nfiled   with   the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   This   shelf\nregistration was for the registration of debt and other securities for an\naggregate  offering  amount of $500 million.   The  notes  were  sold  at\n99.925%  of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The  notes\npay  interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.   The  6.51%\nfixed  rate  was  subsequently effectively converted to a  floating  rate\nthrough ten-year interest rate swaps based on the three-month U.S. dollar\nLondon  Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\").  To mitigate  the  credit  risk\nassociated  with  these ten-year swap transactions, the  Company  entered\ninto  margining  agreements  with  its third-party  bank  counterparties.\nMargining under these agreements does not start until 1997.  Furthermore,\nthese agreements would require the Company to post margin only if certain\ncredit  risk thresholds were exceeded.  It is anticipated that any margin\nthe  Company  may  be required to post in the future  would  not  have  a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's liquidity position.\n\nThe  Company expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term\nborrowings  from time to time to finance U.S. working capital  needs  and\ncapital  expenditures,  because a substantial portion  of  the  Company's\ncash,  cash  equivalents, and short-term investments is held  by  foreign\nsubsidiaries,  generally  in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.   Amounts\nheld  by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation\nupon   repatriation  to  the  United  States;  the  Company's   financial\nstatements  fully provide for any related tax liability on  amounts  that\nmay be repatriated.  Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on pages 31 -  32\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nThe  Company  believes that its balances of cash, cash  equivalents,  and\nshort-term investments, together with funds generated from operations and\nshort-  and long-term borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to  meet\nits operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n                                       17\n##PAGE\n"}, "1996": {"item1": "Item 1. Business\n\nGeneral\n\nApple Computer, Inc. (\"Apple\" or the \"Company\") was incorporated under \nthe laws of the State of California on January 3, 1977.  The Company's \nprincipal executive offices are located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, \nCalifornia, 95014 and its telephone number is (408) 996-1010.\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets microprocessor-based \npersonal computers and related personal computing and communicating \nsolutions for sale primarily to education, home, business and government \ncustomers.  Substantially all of the Company's net sales to date have been \nderived from the sale of personal computers from its Apple Macintosh(registered\ntrademark) line of computers and related software and peripherals.  The Company\noperates in one principal industry segment across geographically diverse \nmarketplaces.\n\nDuring 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring \nactions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness,\nand restoring sustained profitibility.  The Company's restructuring actions \nhave included the termination of employees, as well as the sale of the \nCompany's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, \nInc. (\"SCI\").  As part of the terms of this sale, the Company is committed\nto purchase product manufactured by SCI in the future.

These Power Macintosh products not only support \nvirtually all existing Macintosh applications, but can also run MS-DOS \nand Windows applications when using SoftWindows(trademark) software from \nInsignia Solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t2\n##PAGE\n\n\nMacintosh Performa\n\nThe Performa family of personal computers is designed to appeal primarily \nto first-time personal computer users.  These products feature all-in-one\nbox computing solutions, including software and hardware chosen \nspecifically with home users in mind. \n\nMacintosh PowerBook\n\nThe PowerBook family of portable computer products is specifically \ndesigned for mobile computing needs.  All PowerBook personal computers \ninclude software designed to enhance mobile computing.\n\nPeripheral Products\n\nThe Company sells associated computer peripherals, including the \nImageWriter(registered trademark), StyleWriter(registered trademark),\nColor StyleWriter and LaserWriter(registered trademark) printer \nfamilies, CD-ROM and magnetic disk drives, scanners, a range of color \nmonitors, and the QuickTake(registered trademark) 150 digital camera.\n\nMessagePad and Related Products\n\nThe Apple MessagePad(registered trademark) 130 communications assistant\nintegrates Newton(registered trademark) technology in a hand-held mobile\ncomputer that intelligently assists the user in capturing, organizing and\ncommunicating information. The Apple MessagePad 2000 includes additional\nbuilt-in applications and a faster processor as compared to the Apple\nMessagePad 130.  The Apple eMate 300 integrates Newton technology in a mobile\ncomputer and includes built-in applications.  The product allows students to\nperform preliminary work on the eMate 300 and enhance it on either an existing\nMac OS or Windows software-based desktop computer.  The eMate 300 \nallows students to enter data by keyboard or stylus and also share data and \nfiles with each other, send and receive e-mail, and access the Internet.  The\nCompany plans to begin selling the Apple MessagePad 2000 and the \nApple eMate 300 in early calendar 1997. \n\nOperating System Software and Application Software \n\nThe Company's operating system software, its proprietary Macintosh \nsystem software called Mac OS, provides Apple computers with an easy, \nconsistent user interface and built-in networking capability based on its \nAppleTalk networking standard, as well as other industry networking \nstandards, and ensures integration of hardware and software.  The \nCompany also develops and distributes extensions to the Macintosh system \nsoftware, such as utilities, languages, developer tools, and educational \nsoftware.  Claris Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, \ndevelops, publishes, and distributes application software in a variety of \nestablished personal productivity categories, such as database management \nand graphics, for Macintosh and Windows-based systems.

The \nCompany has recently introduced Cyberdog(registered trademark), a set of tools\nwhich enables the user to customize the way they access and view Internet\ncontent.  The Apple Internet Server Solution consists of a workgroup server\nand both Apple and third-party software which enable the users to establish a\npresence on the World Wide Web.\n\nFurther information regarding the Company's products may be found in \nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Competition\" \nincluded under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and \nFinancial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by \nreference.  \n\t\t\t\t3\n##PAGE\n\nMarkets and Distribution\n \nThe Company's customers are primarily in the education, home, business \nand government markets.  Certain customers are attracted to the Macintosh \nfor a variety of reasons, including the availability of a wide variety of \ncertain application software, the reduced amount of training resulting from \nthe Macintosh's intuitive ease of use, and the ability of the Macintosh to \nnetwork and communicate with other computer systems and environments.\n \nApple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in \nthe late 1970s.  In the United States, the Company is one of the major \nsuppliers of personal computers for both elementary and secondary school \ncustomers, as well as for college and university customers.  The Company \nis also a substantial supplier to institutions of higher education outside of\nthe United States.\n  \nPresently, the Americas represent the Company's largest geographic \nmarketplace.  The Apple Americas organization focuses on the Company's \nsales, marketing, and support efforts in North and South America.  \nProducts sold in these regions are primarily manufactured in the \nCompany's facilities in California and Singapore, and in the SCI facility in \nColorado, and are distributed from the Company's facility in California and \nfrom a third-party facility in Illinois.\n \nApproximately 46% to 52% of the Company's revenues in recent years has \ncome from its international operations.  The Company's international sales \nand marketing divisions consist of: Apple Americas; Apple Europe, \nMiddle East and Africa (\"Apple EMEA\"); Apple Japan; and Apple Asia \nPacific (which does not include Japan).  The marketing divisions focus on \nopportunities in their regions.  Products sold by Apple EMEA are \nmanufactured primarily in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland.  \nProducts sold by Apple Americas, Apple Japan, and Apple Asia Pacific are \nmanufactured primarily in the Company's facilities in California and \nSingapore, and in the SCI facility in Colorado.\n \nThe Company distributes its products through third-party computer \nresellers, and is also continuing its expansion into various consumer \nchannels, such as mass merchandise stores, consumer electronics outlets \nand computer superstores, in response to changing industry practices and \ncustomer preferences.  The Company's products are sold primarily to \nbusiness and government customers through independent resellers, value-\nadded resellers and systems integrators; to home customers through \nindependent resellers and consumer channels; and to education customers \nthrough direct sales and independent resellers.  In order to provide \nproducts and service to its independent resellers on a timely basis, the \nCompany distributes its products through a number of Apple and third-\nparty distribution and support centers.\n\nA summary of the Company's Industry Segment and Geographic \nInformation may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under Notes \nto Consolidated Financial Statements under the heading \"Industry Segment \nand Geographic Information,\" which information is hereby incorporated by \nreference.\n\nRaw materials  \n\nAlthough certain components essential to the Company's business are \ngenerally available from multiple sources, key components and processes \ncurrently obtained from single sources include certain of the Company's \ndisplays, microprocessors, mouse devices, keyboards, disk drives, printers \nand printer components, application-specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\") \nand other custom chips, and certain processes relating to construction of \nthe plastic housing for the Company's computers.  Any availability \nlimitations, interruption in supplies, or price increases relative to these and\nother components could adversely affect the Company's business and \nfinancial results.  In addition, new products introduced by the Company \noften initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source, \nuntil the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for an additional \nsupplier.  In situations where a component or product utilizes new \ntechnologies, there may be initial capacity constraints until such time as \nthe suppliers' yields have matured.  Components are normally acquired \nthrough purchase orders, as is common in the industry, typically covering \nthe Company's requirements for periods from 90 to 180 days. However, \nthe Company continues to evaluate the need for a supply contract in each \nsituation.\n\nIf the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to \nbe delayed or curtailed, the Company's ability to ship the related product \nutilizing that component in desired quantities and in a timely manner could \nbe adversely affected.  The Company's business and financial performance \ncould also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain \nsufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain \nsufficient quantities from an alternate source.  The Company believes that \nthe suppliers whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse \neffect upon the Company's business and financial position include, at this\n\n\t\t\t\t4\n##PAGE\n\n \ntime: Canon, Inc., General Electric Co., IBM, Motorola, Inc., Sharp\nCorporation, Sony Corporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., and/or their United\nStates affiliates VLSI Technology, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Quantum\nCorporation, and SCI. However, the Company helps mitigate these potential risks\nby working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction\nplans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and \nmanufacturing schedules and levels.  The Company believes that most of \nits single-source suppliers, including most of the foregoing companies, are \nreliable multinational corporations.  Most of these suppliers manufacture \nthe relevant components in multiple plants.  The Company further believes \nthat its long-standing business relationships with these and other key \nsuppliers are strong and mutually beneficial in nature.  \n\nThe Company has also from time to time experienced significant price \nincreases and limited availability of certain components that are available \nfrom multiple sources.  Any similar occurrences in the future could have \nan adverse affect on the Company's operating results.\n \nThe Company is obligated to purchase certain percentages of its total \nannual volumes of CPUs and logic boards from SCI over each of the next \nthree years (see Exhibit 10.B.14 hereto).  In addition, the Company has a \nsupply agreement with Motorola, Inc. (see Exhibit 10.B.12 hereto).  The \nagreement with Motorola continues for five years from January 31, 1992 \nunless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties.  The Company \nsingle-sources certain microprocessors from Motorola. The supply \nagreement does not obligate the Company to make minimum purchase \ncommitments; however, the agreement does commit the vendor to supply \nthe Company's requirements of the particular items for the duration of the \nagreement. \n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and \nproduct may be found under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \nsubheading \"Inventory and Supply\" included under the heading \"Factors \nThat May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, \nItem 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial \nStatements under the subheading \"Concentrations in the Available Sources \nof Supply of Materials and Product\" included under the heading \n\"Concentrations of Risk,\" and under the subheading \"Purchase \nCommitment\" included under the heading \"Commitments and \nContingencies,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nPatents, trademarks, copyrights and licenses\n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to \ncertain aspects of its computer and peripheral systems.  In addition, the \nCompany has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the \nUnited States and a number of foreign countries for \"Apple\", the Apple \nsilhouette logo, the Apple color logo, \"Macintosh\", Newton, the Newton \nLightbulb logo, Claris and numerous other product trademarks. In 1986, the \nCompany acquired ownership of the trademark \"Macintosh\" for use in \nconnection with computer products.  Although the Company believes that \nthe ownership of such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important \nfactor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the \nownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, \ntechnical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nBecause of technological changes in the computer industry, current \nextensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it\nis possible that certain components of the Company's products may \nunknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company believes \nthe resolution of any claim of infringements would not have a material \nadverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations as \nreported in the accompanying financial statements.  However, depending \non the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of any such claims \nof infringement, it is possible that the Company's future results of \noperations or cash flow could be materially affected in a particular period.  \nThe Company has from time to time entered into cross-licensing \nagreements with other companies.\n\nSeasonal business\n\nAlthough the Company does not consider its business to be highly \nseasonal, it has historically experienced increased sales in its first and \nfourth fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to \nholiday demand for and calendar year-end buying of some of its products.  \nHowever, past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of \nthe Company's future revenue or financial performance. \n\n\t\t\t\t5\n##PAGE\n\n\nWarranty\n\nThe Company offers a parts and labor limited warranty on its products.  \nThe warranty period is one year from the date of purchase by the end user.  \nThe Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple service parts used \nto repair Apple hardware products.  In addition, consumers may purchase \nextended service coverage on all Apple hardware products.\n\nSignificant Customers\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in \n1996, 1995, and 1994.\n\nBacklog\n\nIn general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed \nbasis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates \ndepending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders (backlog) can \nbe, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill orders on \nthe requested delivery schedules.  However, products may be in relatively \nshort supply from time to time until production volumes have reached a \nlevel sufficient to meet demand or if other production or fulfillment  \nconstraints exist.  The Company's backlog of unfilled orders decreased to \napproximately $563 million at November 29, 1996 from $618 million at \nDecember 1, 1995.  The Company's backlog at November 29, 1996 \nconsisted primarily of the Company's PowerBook products, as well as \nhigher-end Power Macintosh products.  The Company expects that \nsubstantially all of its orders in backlog at November 29, 1996 will be \neither shipped or canceled during fiscal 1997. \n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any \nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business \nprospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or \nimmediately following introduction of new products because of \noverordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced \nonce dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.  \nBecause of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's \nbacklog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the \nCompany's future revenue or financial performance.  Further information \nregarding the Company's backlog may be found under Part II, Item 7 of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K under the subheading \"Net Sales\" \nincluded under the heading \"Results of Operations,\" and under the \nsubheading \"Product Introductions and Transitions\" included under the \nheading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial \nCondition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\nCompetition\n\nThe market for the design, manufacture and sale of personal computers, \nMessagePad and related products, and related software and peripheral \nproducts is highly competitive.  It continues to be characterized by rapid \ntechnological advances in both hardware and software development that \nhave substantially increased the capabilities and applications of these \nproducts, and has resulted in the frequent introduction of new products. \nThe principal competitive factors in this market are relative \nprice/performance, product quality and reliability, availability of software, \nproduct features, marketing and distribution capability, service and \nsupport, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. \n\nFurther discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal \ncomputing industry and the Company's competitive position in the market \nplace may be found under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \nsubheading \"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors That May \nAffect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, Item 8 on \nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under \nthe subheading \"Reserves Against Inventories\" under the heading \n\"Accounting Estimates,\" which information is hereby incorporated by \nreference.\n\n\t\t\t\t6\n##PAGE\n\nResearch and development\n\nBecause the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid \ntechnological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is \nheavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow \nof competitive products to the marketplace.  The Company continues to \ndevelop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products \nin the areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, networking and \ncommunications, and the Internet. The Company's research and \ndevelopment expenditures totaled $604 million, $614 million, and $564 \nmillion in fiscal years 1996, 1995, and 1994, respectively.\n\nFurther information regarding the Company's R&D expenditures for fiscal \nyear 1996 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \nheading \"Operating Expenses,\" which information is hereby incorporated \nby reference.\n\nEnvironmental laws\n\nCompliance with United States federal, state, and local laws enacted for \nthe protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon \nthe Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. \nAlthough the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in \nthe future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws,\nno assurance can be given that such laws, or any future laws enacted for \nthe protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect \non the Company.\n\nEmployees\n\nAt September 27, 1996, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 10,896 \nregular employees, and an additional 2,502 temporary or part-time \ncontractors and employees.\n\nForeign and domestic operations and geographic data\n\nInformation regarding financial data by geographic area and the risks \nassociated with international operations is set forth under Part II, Item 8 of\nthis Form 10-K under the heading \"Industry Segment and Geographic \nInformation,\" and under Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the \nsubheading \"Global Market Risks,\" included under the heading \"Factors \nThat May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" which \ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\nMargins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on domestic \nsales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, \ncan be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations \nand by international trade regulations, including tariffs and anti-dumping \npenalties.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "Item 7.

This decline in demand and the resulting losses, coupled \nwith intense price competition throughout the industry, led to the \nCompany's decision to implement a new strategic direction intended to \nimprove the Company's competitiveness and restore its profitability.  The \nCompany has initiated programs to develop and market products and \nservices more selectively targeted to education, home, and business \nsegments.  In moving in this new strategic direction, the Company expects \nto reduce the number of new product introductions and the number of \nproducts in certain categories within its current product portfolio.\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, \ndecreasing $1,229 million, or 11%; $1,545 million, or 19%; and $682 \nmillion, or 23%; during the twelve, nine, and three months ended \nSeptember 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in \n1995, due to a decrease in net sales of Macintosh(registered trademark)\ncomputers and of peripheral products such as displays and printers.  Total\nMacintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter\nof 1996, decreasing 11%, 19%, and 26% during the twelve, nine, and three\nmonths ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same \nperiods in 1995. This decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack\nof growth in worldwide demand for all product families, which the \nCompany believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the \nCompany's strategic direction, financial condition, and future prospects, \nand due to delays in the shipment of certain PowerBook(registered trademark)\nproducts as a result of quality problems.  In addition, unit sales of\nperipheral products trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,\ndecreasing 20%, 24%, and 30% during the twelve, nine and three months ended\nSeptember 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in \n1995, for the reasons noted above.  The average aggregate revenue per \nMacintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months \nended September 27, 1996, and decreased slightly during the nine months \nended September 27, 1996, compared with the same periods in 1995, \nprimarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the Company's \nnewer products and products with multimedia configurations, offset to \nvarying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines in order to \n\n\t\t\t\t12\n##PAGE\n\nstimulate demand.  The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was\nflat during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996\ncompared with the same periods in 1995.  The average revenue per Macintosh and\nper peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a\nvariety of factors, including industrywide pricing pressures and increased\ncompetition. \n\nInternational net sales represented 52% of net sales in 1996 compared with \n48% of net sales in 1995.  International net sales trended downward \nbeginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 3%, 11% and 13% \nduring the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, \nrespectively, compared with the same periods in 1995.  Net sales in \nEuropean markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of \n1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended \nSeptember 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995, as a result of \na decrease in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, partially offset by an \nincrease in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per \nperipheral unit, primarily during the first part of the year.  Net sales in \nJapan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, \ndecreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, \n1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.  An increase in Macintosh \nunit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the \naverage aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit and a \ndecrease in peripheral unit sales.  Domestic net sales trended downward \nbeginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing by 18%, 26%, and \n30% for the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, \nrespectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 1995, resulting \nfrom a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families.\n\nAccording to an industry source, in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared \nwith the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the worldwide and \nU.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.4% from 8.7%, and to 7.3% \nfrom 13.2%, respectively. \n\nNet sales increased $1,873 million, or 20%, in 1995 over 1994, primarily \ndue to a combination of unit growth, higher average selling prices, and \nchanges in currency exchange rates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales \nincreased approximately 15% over the prior year.  This unit sales growth \nresulted principally from strong sales of the Company's Power \nMacintosh(registered trademark) products, which accounted for more than 70%\nof total unit shipments during the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with 26%\nin the comparable period of 1994, and from sales of newer product offerings \nwithin the Performa(registered trademark) family of desktop personal computers.\nThis unit growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the\nCompany's older product offerings.  The average aggregate revenue per \nMacintosh unit increased 12% in 1995 compared with 1994, primarily due \nto a shift in product mix toward the Company's newer products and \nproducts with multimedia configurations.\n\nInternational net sales represented 48% of net sales in 1995 compared with \n46% of net sales in 1994.  International net sales grew 25% in 1995 from \n1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific region, \nparticularly Japan.  Domestic net sales increased 16% in 1995 over 1994.\n\nIn general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed \nbasis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates \ndepending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ('backlog') \ncan be, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill \norders on the requested delivery schedules.  However, products may be in \nrelatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have \nreached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or \nfulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog was approximately \n$563 million at November 29, 1996, and consisted primarily of the \nCompany's PowerBook products, as well as higher-end Power Macintosh \nproducts.\n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any \nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business \nprospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or \nimmediately following introduction of new products because of \noverordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced \nonce dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.  \nBecause of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's \nbacklog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the \nCompany's future revenue or financial performance. \n\nThe Company believes that net sales will remain below the level of the \nprior year's comparable periods through at least the first quarter of 1997, if\nnot later.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be \nable to achieve sales levels in the first quarter of 1997 comparable to the \nlevels achieved in the fourth quarter of 1996.\n\n\t\t\t\t13\n##PAGE\n\nGross Margin \n\nGross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales \nand its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of \nproducts is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for its \nproducts relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based \nprimarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor \ncosts.  The type and cost of components included in particular \nconfigurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk \ndrives) are often directly related to the need to market products in \nconfigurations competitive with those of other manufacturers.  \nCompetition in the personal computer industry is intense, and in the short \nterm, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often \nnecessary in order to remain competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a \npercentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by \nactions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide \ncompetitive pressures.\n\nGross margin decreased to 9.8% in 1996 compared with 25.8% in 1995.  \nThis decrease is primarily the result of a $616 million charge in the second \nquarter of 1996 for the write-down of certain inventory, as well as the \ncosts to cancel excess component orders, necessitated by significantly \nlower than expected demand for many of the Company's products, \nprimarily its entry-level products.  Also, the Company separately incurred \napproximately $145 million in charges during the last nine months of 1996 \nto provide for the estimated costs to correct certain quality problems in \ncertain entry-level, Performa, PowerBook and peripheral products, \ncovering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods.  The Company \nalso incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during 1996 \ncompared with 1995.  In addition, this decrease in gross margins is due to \nthe Company's response to extreme competitive actions by other \ncompanies attempting to gain market share, including the Company's \npricing actions in the United States, Japan and Europe across most product \nlines, which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain \nproduct components.  In the first quarter of 1997, the Company took, and \nthe Company expects that it will continue to take, similar pricing actions \nwith respect to a number of product lines.\n\nThe decrease in gross margin levels was slightly offset by hedging gains, \nnet of the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign \ncurrencies.  The Company's operating and pricing strategies take into \naccount changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's \nresults of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by \nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.   \n\nGross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in \n1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage \nof net sales was primarily a result of a shift in product mix toward the \nCompany's newer, high-margin products, which included strong sales of \ncertain products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of \npersonal computers and its Macintosh Performa family.  The increase in \ngross margin levels was affected favorably by changes in foreign currency \nexchange rates as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign\ncurrencies in 1995 compared with 1994. \n\nAlthough gross margin for 1996 was 9.8%, it improved to 22.0% during \nthe fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower component costs, sales of \nfully reserved product, and a shift in product mix toward the Company's \nnewer products and products with multimedia configurations, which tend \nto have higher margins.  There can be no assurance that the Company will \nbe able to sustain the gross margin level achieved in the fourth quarter.  \nGross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a \nvariety of factors, including continued industrywide pricing pressures, \nincreased competition, and compressed product life cycles.  Gross margins \ncould also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage \nquality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand for certain \nof its products.\n\n\nResearch and Development\t1996\tChange\t1995\tChange\t1994\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t \t  \t \t \t \t\t\t\t\nResearch and development\t$604     (2%)\t$614      9%\t$564         \n  Percentage of net sales\t6.1%\t\t5.6%\t\t6.1%\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nResearch and development expenditures decreased slightly in 1996 when \ncompared with 1995, primarily due to the termination of certain third-party \njoint development efforts.  The increase as a percentage of net sales \nresulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. The increase in research \nand development expenditures during 1995 compared with 1994 reflected \nhigher project- and headcount-related spending.  The decrease as a \npercentage of net sales was the result of revenue growth in 1995 over \n1994.\n\n\t\t\t\t14\n##PAGE\n\nThe Company believes that continued investments in research and \ndevelopment are critical to its future growth and competitive position in \nthe marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development \nof new and enhanced products.

The \nincrease as a percentage of net sales in 1996 when compared with 1995 \nwas the result of reduced net sales.  In 1995, selling, general and \nadministrative expenses increased as a result of increased advertising and \nchannel marketing programs.  The decrease as a percentage of net sales \nwas primarily the result of the sales growth in 1995 over 1994.\n\nAs a result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that selling, \ngeneral and administrative expenditures in 1997 will decrease compared \nwith 1996 levels. \n\nRestructuring Costs\n\nFor information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, refer to \npage 39 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\n\nInterest and Other\nIncome(Expense), Net\t1996\tChange\t1995\tChange\t1994\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \t  \t  \t \t  \t\t\t\t\t\nInterest and other\nincome(expense), net\t$ 88      NM \t$(10)    55% \t$(22)    \n     \t\t\t\t\t\n\nInterest and other income (expense), net, increased to $88 million in \nincome in 1996 from $10 million in expense in 1995.  This $98 million \nfavorable change is primarily composed of a favorable variance of $78 \nmillion related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging \ngains, and lower foreign exchange hedging costs, primarily as a result of \nlower market and option volatility, higher U.S. interest rates compared \nwith rates abroad, and reduced foreign currency cash flows; an increase of \n$73 million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the Company's \navailable-for-sale and other equity securities during 1996; offset by a $52 \nmillion unfavorable variance related to interest income (expense), as a \nresult of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances \nduring the year, and an overall decline in average interest rate yields. In\naddition, the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the \ndowngrading from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt \nto NP and C by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating \nAgency, respectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's \nInvestor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.\n\nIn 1995, interest and other income (expense), net, decreased to $10 million \nin expense from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12 million \nfavorable change was primarily composed of $49 million in interest \nincome (expense) attributable to higher average cash balances, higher \ninterest rates, and interest rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36 \nmillion unfavorable variance related to realized and unrealized foreign \nexchange hedging losses and foreign exchange hedging costs.

A substantial portion of this \nasset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax \nliabilities. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is \ndependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 \nmillion of future U.S. taxable income.  Management believes that it is \nmore likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S.\nincome.   However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet \nits expectations of future U.S. income.  As a result, the amount of the \ndeferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and \nlong term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced.  Such an \noccurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial \nresults and condition.  The Company will continue to evaluate the \nrealizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a \nvaluation allowance.  For additional information regarding income taxes, \nrefer to pages 40 - 41 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\n\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition are \ndependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, \nand market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic \ncustomer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors \nthat the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable \nfuture operating results and financial condition.  Potential risks and \nuncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and \nfinancial condition include, without limitation, continued competitive \npressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the \nCompany to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the \nCompany; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery to the \nmarketplace of successful technological innovations; the effects of \nsignificant adverse publicity; the Company's ability to supply products in \ncertain categories; and uncertainties concerning the Company's ability to \nsuccessfully implement its new strategic direction and restructuring \nactions.\n\nThe Company expects that it will not return to sustained profitability until \nat least the second quarter of 1997, if not later.\n\nRestructuring of Operations\n\nDuring 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring \nactions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, \nand restoring sustained profitability.  There are several risks inherent in the\nCompany's efforts to transition to a new cost structure.  These include the \nrisk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly \nenough to restore sustained profitability and the risk that cost-cutting \ninitiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain \ncompetitive in the computer industry.  \n\nAs part of its restructuring effort, the Company has begun to implement a \nnew business model. Implementation of the new business model involves \nseveral risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the \nCompany will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially \nreduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and \ntechnology. Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing \nthe proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under \noutsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality \nor quantity of the products manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make \ntimely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing \nmarket conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely \naffect employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain \nand motivate employees. Also, because the new business model contemplates that\nthe Company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing\narrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control\nover certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to create\ninnovative new products may be reduced. Finally, even if the new business model\nis successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively\nresolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In addition,\nalthough the Company believes that the actions it is taking under its\nrestructuring plan should help restore marketplace confidence in the\nMacintosh platform, there can be no assurance that such actions will be\nsuccessful.\n\t\t\t\t16\n##PAGE\n\nFor the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current \nrestructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not\nbe required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and \nfinancial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter \ndifficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business model \nand cost structure.\n\nFor more information regarding the Company's restructuring actions \ninitiated in the second quarter of 1996, refer to page 39 of the \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nProduct Introductions and Transitions \n\nDue to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which \nis characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid \ntechnological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products \nand product enhancements.  The success of new product introductions is \ndependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the \nCompany's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, \nthe availability of application software for new products, the effective \nmanagement of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, \nthe availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated \ndemand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects \nin the early stages of introduction.  Accordingly, the Company cannot \ndetermine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or \nresults of operations.  In addition, although the number of new product \nintroductions may decrease under the Company's new business model, the \nrisks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may \nincrease as the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth \nsegments.\n\nThe rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a \nnew product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments \nfor that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not \nunder the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large \npurchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase \nnew technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users (\"early \nadopters\"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who \nanticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of other \nproducts; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the \naforementioned factors.  These factors may be offset by others, such as the \ndeferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as \n\"proven\" and for which commonly used software products are available; \nand the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain \nsufficient supply of products previously in backlog. \n\nBacklog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the \naforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with \nintroduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they \ncan obtain sufficient supply of the new products. \n\nThe measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further \ncomplicated by the availability of different product configurations, which \nmay include various types of built-in peripherals and software.  \nConfigurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for \nvarious markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas may \nbe a function of the availability of third-party software in those localized \nversions.  For example, the availability of European-language versions of \nsoftware products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the \navailability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result in lower \ninitial demand for the Company's new products outside the United States, \neven though localized versions of the Company's products may be \navailable.\n\nThe increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of the \nCompany's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults\ncould be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products \nhave been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant, the \nCompany could incur material recall and replacement costs under product \nwarranties.\n\n\t\t\t\t17\n##PAGE\n\nCompetition\n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized \nby aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, \nfrequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual \nimprovement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity \non the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors.  During \n1996, the Company's results of operations and financial condition were, \nand in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industrywide \npricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The industry \nhas also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software \nfunctionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or \nemerging industry standards.  Many of the Company's competitors have \ngreater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources; \nbroader product lines; and larger installed customer bases than those of the \nCompany.\n\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition may be \naffected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer \npreferences for one platform over another or one set of product features \nover another.\n\nThe Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the \nMacintosh operating system (\"Mac(registered trademark) OS\").  The Mac OS has a\nminority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by \nmakers of computers that run the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows \noperating systems.  The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its \nperceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving \nforce behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the \npast several years.  Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including \nthose introduced by Windows 95, have added features to the Windows \nplatform similar to those offered by the Mac OS.  The Company is \ncurrently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the \ncompetitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a \nresult of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.  The Company's \nfuture operating results and financial condition may be affected by its \nability to maintain and increase the installed base for the Macintosh \nplatform.  The Company recently announced a new strategy with respect to \nupdating its operating system while redesigning its plan for a next-\ngeneration operating system.  To extend the life of its current operating \nsystem, the Company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of \ndiscrete operating system components.  The Company expects that this \nwill enable it to introduce some new functionality for the current operating \nsystem sooner than it would be able to introduce a completely new \noperating system.  Concurrently, the Company will continue development \nof its next-generation operating system, focusing on increased \nfunctionality at the possible expense of some backward compatibility.  \nDiminished backward compatibility in its new operating system could \nresult in a loss of existing customers.  Inability to introduce a next-\ngeneration operating system on a timely basis, or to gain developer support \nand market accepatance for it, may have an adverse impact on the \nCompany's operating results and financial condition.  \n\nAs part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh \nplatform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other \npersonal computer vendors in January 1995, as well as an additional \nlicensing initiative in 1996.   Several vendors currently sell products that \nutilize the Macintosh operating system.  The Company believes that \nlicensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on \nwhich software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations for \nthe Macintosh platform.  However, there can be no assurance that the \ninstalled base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or \nthat licensing will result in an increase in the number of application \nsoftware titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to market application\nsoftware based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as a result of licensing its \noperating system, the Company is forced to compete with other companies \nproducing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits to the Company \nfrom licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by the \ndisadvantages of being required to compete with them.\n\nAs a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS \nand Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward \ndeveloping personal computer products capable of running application \nsoftware designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems \n(\"Cross-Platform Products\"). These products include the RISC-based \nPowerPC(trademark) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 586-class\nmicroprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium \nor 586-class microprocessor.  These products enable users to run \nconcurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows \n3.1, or Windows 95 operating systems. \n\nDepending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who \npurchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system \nsoftware under licensing agreements with Microsoft.  However, in order to \ndo so, the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements with \ncertain Microsoft distributors.  \n\n\t\t\t\t18\n##PAGE\n\nThe Company, International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\") and \nMotorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of \nspecifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware reference \nplatform.  These specifications define a \"unified\" personal computer \narchitecture that gives access to both the Power Macintosh platform and \nthe PC environment.  The Company's future operating results and financial \ncondition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this \nagreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new \nhardware reference platform. \n\nDecisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as \nopposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the \navailability of third-party software for particular applications.  The \nCompany believes that the availability of third-party application software \nfor the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party \ndevelopers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, \nmaintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products \nversus software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This \nanalysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company \nand its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, \nand the costs of developing such software products.  To the extent the \nCompany's recent financial losses and declining demand for the \nCompany's product have caused software developers to question the \nCompany's position in the personal computer market, developers could be \nless inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing \nsoftware for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their \nresources to developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS \nand Windows market.  Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of \napplication software for the Company's products.  Accordingly, \nMicrosoft's interest in producing application software for the Company's \nproducts may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the \nvendor of the Windows operating systems. \n\nThe Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also \ndependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of the \nPowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to \nsupply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce \nsuperior price/performance results compared with those supplied to the \nCompany's competitors by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer \nof the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the MS-\nDOS and Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers \nbased on Intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the \nPowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing \noperating system to the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's interest \nin supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the Company's \nproducts may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a \ncompeting manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing \noperating system vendor.  \n\nSeveral competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and \nMicrosoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target \ncertain of the Company's key market segments, including education and \npublishing.  Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, \nmanufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.\n\nThe Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and existing \nhardware and software platforms.  There can be no assurance that the \nCompany will be able to continue to do so successfully.  In addition, the \nInternet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing \nnumber of market entrants who have introduced or developed products \naddressing access to, authoring for, or communication over, the Internet.  \nMany of these competitors have a significant lead over the Company in \ndeveloping products for the Internet, have significantly greater financial, \nmarketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company, \nor both.\n\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition may also \nbe affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize \non its investments in other markets, such as the markets for MessagePad\n(registered trademark) and related products. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t19\n##PAGE\n\nGlobal Market Risks \n\nA large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international \noperations.  As a result, the Company's operations and financial results \ncould be significantly affected by international factors, such as changes in \nforeign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the \nforeign markets in which the Company distributes its products.  When the \nU.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of \nnon-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the \nU.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. \nCorrespondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs \nincreases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar \nstrengthens.  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other \nthan the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is \nadversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies \nworldwide.  Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a \nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's \nconsolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars). \n\nTo mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates \non the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and \noperating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar-\nbased exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange \nforward and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.  \nCurrently, hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond \none year.  The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts \nto hedge certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions.  \nHedges of probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not \nextend beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with these \nongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also regularly \nsells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other \nforeign exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and option \ncontracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions intended \nto reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange \nhedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each \nbalance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  \n\nWhile the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest \nrates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the \nCompany's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in \nthe general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S. \ninterest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash \nequivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid on its notes \npayable to banks and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact of \nfluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into interest \nrate swap, collar, and floor transactions.  Certain of these transactions are \nintended to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its \ncash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the fixed-rate \ninterest expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into these \ntransactions in order to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure \naway from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  These instruments \nmay extend the Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum \nduration of three years.\n\nTo ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign \nexchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks \nand opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually \nmonitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest \nrate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in \nconjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related \nexposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic \nperspective.  However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk \nmanagement activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned \nprograms will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact \nresulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or \ninterest rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of \ngains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given \nperiod may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the \nunderlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the \nCompany's operating results and financial position.  The Company \ngenerally does not engage in leveraged hedging. \n\nThe Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the \ncosts of its hedging transactions, as well as the willingness of its financial\ncounter-parties to enter into hedging transactions with the Company.\n\nInventory and Supply\n\nIn line with the Company's efforts to redesign its business model, the \nCompany is taking steps to streamline its product portfolios in its key \nusage areas in education, business, and the home.  This planned \nsimplification of product lines has resulted in inventory reserves.   \nCancelation fees related to custom component inventory purchased for \nanticipated product introductions that have been canceled have also been \npaid or accrued.  The Company has also separately provided for the \nestimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain entry-level, \nPerforma, PowerBook, and peripheral products.  Although the Company \nbelieves its inventory and related reserves are adequate, no assurance can \nbe given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related \ncharges.\n\n\t\t\t\t20\n##PAGE\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory \nwell in advance of product shipments.  Because the Company's markets are \nvolatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk \nthat the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or \ninsufficient inventories of particular products.  The Company's operating \nresults and financial condition have been and may in the future be \nmaterially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its \ninventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand \npatterns.  \n\nCertain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by \nthird-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the \nCompany or otherwise.  As a result of the Company's restructuring actions, \nwhich include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, \nmanufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. (\"SCI\") and a related \nmanufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, the proportion of the \nCompany's products produced and distributed under outsourcing \narrangements will increase.  While outsourcing arrangements may lower \nthe fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the \nCompany has over production.  It is uncertain what effect such diminished \ncontrol will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, \nor the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market \nconditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its \ninventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the Company to \nliquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement.  \n\nMoreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain \nprovisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at \nleast initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.  \nAccordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the \nCompany may remain primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect \nor warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract \nmanufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future \noperating results and financial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited \nby the availability of key components.  The Company has experienced \nsome limitations in supply of certain microprocessors in the first quarter of \n1996.  The Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the \npersonal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs presents the \nmost significant potential for constraining the Company's ability to \nproduce products.  Specific microprocessors manufactured by IBM and \nMotorola, Inc. are currently available only from single sources, while some \nadvanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for \nproduction and thus have limited availability.  The Company and other \nproducers in the personal computer industry also compete for other \nsemiconductor products with other industries that have experienced \nincreased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer \ndemand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the \ncellular phone and automotive industries).  Finally, the Company uses \nsome components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer \nindustry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs).  Continued \navailability of these components may be affected if producers were to \ndecide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of \ncomponents customized to meet the Company's requirements.  Such \nproduct supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could \ndecrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's \noperating results and financial condition.\n\nMarketing and Distribution\n\nA number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the \nCompany's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of \ndistribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers \ninclude consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer \nelectronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business \nand financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition \nof these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were \nto decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.\n\nUncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause resellers \nto reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under \nthe Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to \nreduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances \nwithout financial penalty.  Resellers also have the option to return products \nto the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they \nmay be assessed fees.  The Company has recently experienced a reduction \nin ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty \nconcerning the Company's condition and prospects.\n\nOther Factors\n\nThe majority of the Company's research and development activities, its \ncorporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including \ncertain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The \nCompany's operating results and financial condition could be materially \nadversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.\n\n\t\t\t\t21\n##PAGE\n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may \nsubject the Company to environmental and other regulations which \ninclude, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide \nconsumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of \nits useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or\nrecycling with the Company.  It is unclear what effect such regulation will \nhave on the Company's future operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing \ntransaction systems (which include order management, product \nprocurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system as \npart of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency.  The \nCompany's future operating results and financial condition could be \nadversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively \nmanage the transition to this new integrated system.  \n\nAs part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its Napa, \nCalifornia, data center to MCI Systemhouse (\"MCI\"), and entered into a \ndata processing outsourcing agreement with MCI.  While this outsourcing \nagreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of operations, it will also \nreduce the direct control the Company has over its data processing.  It is \nuncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the Company's \ndata processing.\n\nBecause of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the \nCompany's operating results and financial condition, past financial \nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future \nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate \nresults or trends in future periods.  In addition, the Company's \nparticipation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant \nvolatility of the Company's common stock price.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, \nand short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, increased to \n$1,559 million at September 27, 1996, from $491 million at September 29, \n1995.  The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash \nequivalents, and short-term investments increased to $1,745 million at \nSeptember 27, 1996, from $952 million at September 29, 1995.    The \nCompany's cash and cash equivalent balance at September 27, 1996, \nincludes $177 million pledged as collateral to support letters of credit \nprimarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the \nterms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing \nfacility to SCI.  The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at \nSeptember 29, 1995, includes $90 million pledged as collateral to support \nnotes payable to banks. \n\nCash generated by operations during 1996 totaled $519 million.  Cash \ngenerated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in \ninventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in \naccounts payable and deferred tax liabilities.  As part of the Company's \nrestructuring plan and in order to meet certain liquidity requirements \nduring 1996, the Company generated $145 million of cash from the sale of \ncertain equity investments, and the sale of the Fountain, Colorado, \nmanufacturing facility to SCI and the Napa, California, data center to MCI.  \nThe Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity \ninvestments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less in \n1997 compared with 1996.  Net cash used for the purchase of property, \nplant, and equipment totaled $67 million in 1996, and consisted primarily \nof increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment.  The Company \nexpects that the level of capital expenditures in 1997 will be comparable to \n1996.\n\nNotes payable to banks at September 27, 1996, were approximately $275 \nmillion lower than at September 29, 1995.  During 1996, an outstanding \nloan to Apple Computer B.V., a subsidiary of the Company, was repaid in \nfull.  At September 27, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary of the \nCompany, held $186 million of notes payable to several banks, with \nmaturity dates ranging from the end of December 1996 to May 1997.  The \nmajority of these loans are guaranteed by the Company.\n\nThe Company's balance of long-term debt increased during 1996 due to the \nissuance of $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured \nconvertible subordinated notes to certain qualified parties in a private \nplacement.  These notes were sold at 100% of par.  These notes pay \ninterest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001.  The remainder of \nlong-term borrowings consists of $300 million aggregate principal amount \nof 6.5% unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration \nstatement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.  \nThe notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of \n6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, \n2004.  For more information regarding the Company's long-term debt, \nrefer to pages XX-XX of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n\t\t\t\t22\n##PAGE\n\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies \nfor the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain \nprepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies \nfor the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these \nyears have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of \ndeficiency proposing increases to the amount of the Company's federal \nincome taxes for the years 1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a \npetition with the United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax \ndeficiencies.  Management believes that adequate provision has been made \nfor any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations. \n\nThe Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading \nfrom January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C \nby Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, \nrespectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor \nServices and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In \naddition, the Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with \nrespect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to \nmore stringent covenants than in the past.  The Company believes that its \nbalances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together \nwith continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to \nmeet its operating and other cash requirements, including the impact of \nplanned restructuring actions, on a short- and long-term basis.  No \nassurance can be given that short-term borrowings from banks can be \ncontinued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained \nshould the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or \nbe unsuccessful.  If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its \nliquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially \nadversely affected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t23\n##PAGE\n"}, "1997": {"item1": "ITEM 1.

All of the Company's Macintosh products employ\nPowerPC-TM- RISC-based microprocessors.\n \nPOWER MACINTOSH\n \n    The Power Macintosh \"Flagship\" line of high-performance personal computers\nis targeted at business and professional users and is designed to meet the\nspeed, expansion and networking needs of the most demanding Macintosh user.\nThese Power Macintosh products not only support virtually all existing Macintosh\napplications, but can also run MS-DOS and Windows applications when using\nSoftWindows-TM- software from Insignia Solutions or Virtual PC-TM- software from\nConnectix Corporation.\n \n    The Power Macintosh \"Value\" line of personal computers is designed to appeal\nprimarily to academic, consumer and first-time personal computer users. Many of\nthese products feature all-in-one box computing solutions, including software\nand hardware chosen specifically with home and education users in mind.\n \n                                       1\n##PAGE\nMACINTOSH POWERBOOK\n \n    The PowerBook family of portable computer products is specifically designed\nfor mobile computing needs. All PowerBook personal computers include software\ndesigned to enhance mobile computing.\n \nPERIPHERAL PRODUCTS\n \n    The Company sells certain associated computer peripherals including\nLaserWriter-Registered Trademark- printers and a range of color monitors.\n \nMESSAGEPAD AND EMATE\n \n    The Apple MessagePad-Registered Trademark- 2100 communications assistant\nemploys the Company's proprietary Newton-Registered Trademark-technology in a\nhand-held mobile computer that intelligently assists the user in capturing,\norganizing and communicating information using built-in business software\nprograms, including word processing, Internet e-mail and spreadsheet\napplications. The Apple eMate 300 integrates Newton technology in a mobile\ncomputer designed for use primarily in education. The eMate 300 allows students\nto enter data by keyboard or stylus and share data and files with each other,\nand with Mac OS-Registered Trademark- and Windows-Registered Trademark-\nsoftware-based computers, send and receive e-mail, and access the Internet. The\neMate 300 includes built-in word processing, drawing and spreadsheet\napplications.\n \nOPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE\n \n    The Company's operating system software, its proprietary Macintosh system\nsoftware called Mac OS, provides Macintosh computers with an easy, consistent\nuser interface and built-in networking capability based on its AppleTalk\nnetworking standard, as well as other industry networking standards, and ensures\nintegration of hardware and software. The Company also develops and distributes\nextensions to the Macintosh system software, such as utilities, languages,\ndeveloper tools, and educational software. Claris Corporation, a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of the Company, develops, publishes, and distributes application\nsoftware in a variety of established personal productivity categories, such as\ndatabase management, for Mac OS and Windows-based systems. Claris-Registered\nTrademark- products are distributed primarily through independent software\nresellers. The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to the\ncurrent Mac OS and later introduce a new operating system (code named\n\"Rhapsody\") which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on software\ntechnologies of Apple and those of NeXT Software, Inc. (\"NeXT\") which the\nCompany acquired in 1997.\n \n    The Company previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to\nother personal computer vendors (the \"Clone Vendors\") as part of an effort to\nincrease the installed base for the Macintosh platform. The Company recently\ndetermined that the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under\nthese agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing\nprogram. As a result, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets, including\nthe license to distribute the Mac OS, of Power Computing Corporation (\"PCC\"), a\nClone Vendor, and has no plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements.\n \nSERVERS\n \n    The Workgroup Server family of products provides file, print, Internet, and\napplication services, to varying size workgroups. These products also provide\nApple system connectivity to local area networks, and interoperability with\nother computers and computing environments.\n \nINTERNET INTEGRATION\n \n    Apple's Internet strategy is focused on delivering seamless integration with\nand access to the Internet throughout the Company's product lines.\n \n                                       2\n##PAGE\n    Further information regarding the Company's products may be found in Part\nII, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Competition\" included under\nthe heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nMARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION\n \n    The Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, home,\nbusiness and government markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh\ncomputers for a variety of reasons, including the availability of a wide variety\nof certain application software, the reduced amount of training resulting from\nthe Macintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, and the ability of Macintosh\ncomputers to network and communicate with other computer systems and\nenvironments.\n \n    Apple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in the\nlate 1970s. In the U.S., the Company is one of the major suppliers of personal\ncomputers for both elementary and secondary school customers, as well as for\ncollege and university customers. The Company is also a substantial supplier to\ninstitutions of higher education outside of the U.S.\n \n    The U.S. represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. The U.S.\nis part of the Apple Americas organization which focuses on the Company's sales,\nmarketing, and support efforts in North and South America. Products sold in the\nwestern hemisphere are primarily manufactured in the Company's facilities in\nCalifornia and Singapore, and under contract by SCI Systems, Inc. (\"SCI\") at a\nfacility in Colorado, and are distributed from the Company's facility in\nCalifornia and from a third-party facility in Illinois.\n \n    Approximately 48% to 52% of the Company's revenues in recent years have come\nfrom its international operations. The Company's international sales and\nservices divisions consist of: Apple Americas; Apple Europe, Middle East and\nAfrica (\"Apple EMEA\"); Apple Japan; and Apple Asia Pacific (which does not\ninclude Japan). The marketing divisions focus on sales, marketing and\ndistribution in their regions. Products sold by Apple EMEA are manufactured\nprimarily in the Company's facility in Cork, Ireland. Products sold by Apple\nAmericas, Apple Japan, and Apple Asia Pacific are manufactured primarily in the\nCompany's facilities in California and Singapore, and in the SCI facility in\nColorado.\n \n    The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, mass\nmerchants, cataloguers, and direct to education institutions (collectively\nreferred to as \"resellers\"). In addition, in November 1997 the Company began\nselling many of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the\nCompany's on-line store. The Company has recently revised its channel program,\nincluding decreasing the number of resellers and reducing returns, price\nprotection and certain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel\ninventory, increase inventory turns, and increase product support within the\nchannel.\n \n    A summary of the Company's geographic financial information may be found in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K under Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements under the heading \"Industry Segment and Geographic Information,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nRAW MATERIALS\n \n    Although certain components essential to the Company's business are\ngenerally available from multiple sources, other key components (including\nmicroprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are\ncurrently obtained by the Company from single sources. Any availability\nlimitations, interruption in supplies, or price increases relative to these and\nother components could adversely affect the Company's business and financial\nresults. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially\nutilize custom components obtained from only one source, until the Company has\nevaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. In situations where\na component or product utilizes new technologies, there may be initial capacity\nconstraints until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. Components\nare normally acquired through purchase orders, as is common in the industry,\ntypically\n \n                                       3\n##PAGE\ncovering the Company's requirements for periods from 90 to 180 days. However,\nthe Company continues to evaluate the need for a supply contract in each\nsituation.\n \n    If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be\ndelayed or curtailed, the Company's ability to ship the related product\nutilizing that component in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be\nadversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also\nbe adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\nquantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient\nquantities from an alternate source. The Company believes that the suppliers\nwhose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the\nCompany's business and financial position include, at this time: Canon, Inc.,\nGeneral Electric Co., IBM Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Sharp Corporation, Sony\nCorporation, Texas Instruments, Inc., VLSI Technology, Inc., Quanta Computer,\nInc., Quantum Corporation, NatSteel Electronics Pte. Ltd., and SCI. The Company\nattempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and\nother key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories,\ncoordinated product introductions, and manufacturing schedules and levels. The\nCompany believes that many of its single-source suppliers, including most of the\nforegoing companies, are reliable multinational corporations. The Company also\nbelieves most of these suppliers manufacture the relevant components in multiple\nplants. The Company further believes that its long-standing business\nrelationships with these and other key suppliers are strong and mutually\nbeneficial in nature.\n \n    The Company has also from time to time experienced significant price\nincreases and limited availability of certain components that are available from\nmultiple sources. Any similar occurrences in the future could have an adverse\naffect on the Company's operating results.\n \n    The Company is obligated to purchase certain percentages of its total annual\nvolumes of CPUs and logic boards from SCI over each of the next two years.\n \n    Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and\nproduct may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Inventory and Supply\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect\nFuture Results and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, Item 8 on this Form\n10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading\n\"Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\"\nincluded under the heading \"Concentrations of Risk,\" and under the subheading\n\"Purchase Commitments\" included under the heading \"Commitments and\nContingencies,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES\n \n    The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to\ncertain aspects of its computer and peripheral systems. In addition, the Company\nhas registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the U.S. and a\nnumber of foreign countries for \"Apple\", the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple\ncolor logo, \"Macintosh\", \"Newton\", the Newton Lightbulb logo, \"Claris\" and\nnumerous other product trademarks. In 1986, the Company acquired ownership of\nthe trademark \"Macintosh\" for use in connection with computer products. Although\nthe Company believes that the ownership of such patents, copyrights, and\ntrademarks is an important factor in its business and that its success does\ndepend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the\ninnovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its\npersonnel.\n \n    Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive\npatent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible\nthat certain components of the Company's products may unknowingly infringe\nexisting patents of others. The Company believes the resolution of any claim of\ninfringements would not have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition and results of operations as reported in the accompanying financial\nstatements. However, depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable\nresolution of any such claims of infringement, it is possible that the Company's\nfuture results of operations or cash flow could be materially affected in a\nparticular period. The Company has from time to time entered into\ncross-licensing agreements with other companies.\n \n                                       4\n##PAGE\nSEASONAL BUSINESS\n \n    Although the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal,\nit has historically experienced increased sales in its first and fourth fiscal\nquarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand\nrelated to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. However,\npast performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's\nfuture revenue or financial performance.\n \nWARRANTY\n \n    The Company offers a parts and labor limited warranty on its hardware\nproducts. The warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by\nthe end user. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple service parts\nused to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase\nextended service coverage on all Apple hardware products.\n \nSIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS\n \n    No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 1997,\n1996 or 1995.\n \nBACKLOG\n \n    For information regarding the Company's backlog, refer to Part II, Item 7 of\nthis Form 10-K, under the subheading \"Backlog\", which is included under the\nheading \"Net Sales\", which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nCOMPETITION\n \n    The market for the design, manufacture and sale of personal computers,\npersonal communications devices, and related software and peripheral products is\nhighly competitive. It continues to be characterized by rapid technological\nadvances in both hardware and software development that have substantially\nincreased the capabilities and applications of these products, and has resulted\nin the frequent introduction of new products. The principal competitive factors\nin this market are relative price/performance, product quality and reliability,\navailability of software, product features, marketing and distribution\ncapability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and\ncorporate reputation.\n \n    The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Mac OS.\nThe Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is\ndominated by makers of computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows\nNT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived\nadvantages over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed\nbase to incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind\nsales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past several years.\nRecent innovations in the Windows platform, including those included in Windows\n95 and Windows NT, or those expected to be included in a new version of Windows\nto be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows platform that make\nthe differences between the Mac OS and Microsoft's Windows operating systems\nless significant. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take\nsteps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal\ncomputer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.\nThe Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition is\nsubstantially dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements on\nthe Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional advantages over\ncompeting platforms.\n \n    Further discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal\ncomputing industry and the Company's competitive position in the market place\nmay be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future\nResults and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in\nthe Notes to Consolidated\n \n                                       5\n##PAGE\nFinancial Statements under the subheading \"Provisions for Inventory Write-downs\nand Related Accruals\" under the heading \"Significant Accounting Estimates\",\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n \n    Because the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid\ntechnological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily\ndependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive\nproducts to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and\ntechnologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and\nperipherals, system software, networking and communications, and the Internet.\nThe Company's research and development expenditures, before a charge for\nin-process research and development in 1997, totaled $485 million, $604 million,\nand $614 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.\n \n    Further information regarding the Company's R&D expenditures for 1997, 1996\nand 1995 is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading\n\"Research and Development,\" which information is hereby incorporated by\nreference. For information regarding in-process research and development charges\ntaken in 1997 refer to Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"In-Process Research and Development,\" under the heading \"Special Charges.\"\n \nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS\n \n    Compliance with U.S. federal, state, and local laws and foreign laws enacted\nfor the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon\nthe Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although\nthe Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based\non the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be\ngiven that such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the\nenvironment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n \nEMPLOYEES\n \n    As of September 26, 1997, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 8,437\nregular employees, and an additional 1,739 temporary or part-time contractors\nand employees.\n \nFOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\n \n    Information regarding financial data by geographic area and the risks\nassociated with international operations is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K under the heading \"Industry Segment and Geographic Information,\" and\nin Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Global Market Risks,\"\nincluded under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial\nCondition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \n    Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on domestic\nsales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can\nbe adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by\ninternational trade regulations, including tariffs and anti-dumping penalties.\n ", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n  OF OPERATIONS\n \n    THIS SECTION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS FORM 10-K CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING\nSTATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS\nMAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING\nSTATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT\nLIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED \"FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT\nOPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\" BELOW.\n \n    THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. ALL\nINFORMATION IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.\n \nOVERVIEW\n \n    During 1997, the Company continued to experience declines in net sales,\nunits shipped and share of the personal computer market compared to prior years.\nThe decline in demand and the resulting losses, coupled with intense price\ncompetition throughout the industry, led to the Company's decision to continue\nto restructure its business during 1997 aimed at reducing its core structure,\nimproving its competitiveness and restoring sustainable profitability. The\nCompany's restructuring efforts have included significant headcount reductions,\nsimplifications and modifications of the Company's product lines, increases in\nthe proportion of products manufactured under outsourcing arrangements and the\nimplementation of an on-line store in the U.S. In addition, the Company plans to\nincrease the proportion of products manufactured on a made-to-order basis The\nCompany believes that restructuring actions effected through the fourth quarter\nof 1997, as well as those currently planned to be effected during 1998, will\ndecrease operating expenses in 1998 compared with 1997. There is no assurance\nthat such decreases in operating expenses will be achieved or that, if achieved,\nsuch reductions will be sufficient to offset the decline in the Company's net\nsales.\n \n    In February 1997, the Company acquired NeXT. NeXT developed, marketed and\nsupported software that enables customers to implement business applications on\nthe Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server\nnetworks. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the\noperating results pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date of acquisition have\nbeen included in the Company's consolidated operating results. The total\npurchase price, including the fair value of the net liabilities assumed, was\n$427 million of which $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process\nresearch and development and $52 million was allocated to goodwill and other\nintangible assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged\nto operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other tangible assets are\nbeing amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.\n \n    The Company had previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to\nother personal computer vendors (the \"Clone Vendors\") as part of an effort to\nincrease the installed base for the Macintosh platform. The Company recently\ndetermined that the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under\nthese agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing\nprogram. As a result, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets, including\nthe license to distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a clone vendor, and has no plans\nto renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements.\n \n    The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent\nupon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market\ntechnologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand\npatterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in\nmarketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of\nthe Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that\nthe Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future\noperating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and\nuncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition include, among other things, continued competitive pressures\nin the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to such\ncompetitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; the\navailability of key components on terms acceptable to the Company; the Company's\nability to supply products in certain categories; the Company's ability to\nsupply products free of latent defects or other faults; the Company's\n \n                                       9\n##PAGE\nability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of technological innovations,\nincluding its ability to continue to make timely delivery of planned\nenhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely delivery of a new and\nsubstantially backward-compatible operating system; the Company's ability to\nsuccessfully integrate NeXT technologies, processes and employees with those at\nApple; the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction\nand restructuring actions, including reducing its expenditures; the Company's\nability to attract, motivate and retain employees, including a new Chief\nExecutive Officer; the effects of significant adverse publicity; the\navailability of third-party software for particular applications; and the impact\non the Company's sales, market share and gross margins as a result of the\nCompany winding down its Mac OS licensing program.\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \n\n\n                                                             1997       CHANGE       1996       CHANGE       1995\n                                                           ---------  -----------  ---------  -----------  ---------\n                                                             (TABULAR INFORMATION: DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER\n                                                                                SHARE AMOUNTS)\n                                                                                            \nNet sales................................................  $   7,081         (28%) $   9,833         (11%) $  11,062\nGross margin.............................................  $   1,368          41%  $     968         (66%) $   2,858\n  Percentage of net sales................................        19%                      10%                     26%\nResearch and development.................................  $     485         (20%) $     604          (2%) $     614\n  Percentage of net sales................................         7%                       6%                      6%\nSelling, general and administrative......................  $   1,286         (18%) $   1,568          (1%) $   1,583\n  Percentage of net sales................................        18%                      16%                     14%\nSpecial Charges\n  In-process research and development....................  $     375          NM   $      --          NM   $      --\n    Percentage of net sales..............................         5%                      --%                     --%\n  Restructuring costs....................................  $     217          21%  $     179          NM   $     (23)\n    Percentage of net sales..............................         3%                       2%                     --%\n  Termination of license agreement.......................  $      75          NM   $      --          NM   $      --\n    Percentage of net sales..............................         1%                      --%                     --%\nInterest and other income (expense), net.................  $      25         (72%) $      88          NM   $     (10)\nNet income (loss)........................................  $  (1,045)        (28%) $    (816)       (292%) $     424\nEarnings (loss) per share................................  $   (8.29)        (26%) $   (6.59)       (291%) $    3.45\n\n \n- ------------------------\n \nNM: Not Meaningful\n \nNET SALES\n \nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 26, 1997 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 1996\n \n    Net sales represent the Company's gross sales net of returns, rebates and\ndiscounts. Net sales decreased 28% in 1997 compared with 1996. Total Macintosh\ncomputer unit sales and peripheral unit sales decreased 27% and 33%,\nrespectively, during 1997, compared with 1996, as a result of a decline in\nworldwide demand for most of the Company's product families, which the Company\nbelieves was due principally to continued customer concerns regarding the\nCompany's strategic direction, financial condition and future prospects, and the\nviability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the\nmarketplace. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit decreased slightly\nin 1997 compared with 1996, primarily due to continued pricing actions,\nincluding increased rebates, across most product lines, substantially offset by\na shift in product mix toward the Company's newer and higher priced PowerBook\nproducts. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit did not change in\n1997 compared with 1996.

International net sales declined 30% in 1997\ncompared with 1996. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased during\n1997 compared with 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh computer and\nperipheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in\nJapan, which were partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate\nrevenue per peripheral unit. Further discussion relating to factors contributing\nto the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part II,\nItem 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading \"Global Market Risks\" included under\nthe heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \n    Domestic net sales declined 26% during 1997 compared with 1996, due to\ndecreases in unit sales of Macintosh computers and peripheral products and in\nthe average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. The average aggregate revenue\nper Macintosh unit in the U.S. did not change in 1997 compared with 1996.\n \n    During 1997, as compared with 1996, the Company's estimated share of the\nworldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.6% from 5.7%, and to\n4.6% from 7.4%, respectively, based upon current market information provided by\nindustry sources.\n \n    The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the prior\nyear's comparable periods through at least the second fiscal quarter of 1998, if\nnot longer.\n \nQ4 97 COMPARED WITH Q4 96\n \n    Net sales decreased 30% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the same\nquarter of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral unit sales\ndecreased 30% and 32%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 1997, compared\nwith the same period of 1996, which the Company believes was due principally to\ncontinued customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction,\nfinancial condition and future prospects, and the viability of the Macintosh\nplatform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. The average aggregate\nrevenue per Macintosh unit decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 1997\ncompared with the same period of 1996, as a result of continued pricing actions,\nincluding increased rebates, across most product lines, partially offset by an\nincrease in the average aggregate revenue per Powerbook unit. The average\naggregate revenue per peripheral product also decreased slightly for the\nforegoing reasons. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit and\nper peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a\nvariety of factors, including industrywide pricing pressures, increased\ncompetition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products.\n \n    International net sales represented 42% of total net sales in the fourth\nquarter of 1997 compared with 47% of net sales in the same period of 1996.\nInternational net sales declined 38% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with\nthe same period of 1996. Net sales decreased in the European markets and\ndecreased significantly in Japan during the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with\nthe same period of 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral\nunit sales in Europe and Japan and in the average aggregate revenue per\nperipheral unit in the European markets and the average aggregate revenue per\nMacintosh unit in Japan. These decreases were partially offset by increases in\nthe average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in Europe and the average\naggregate revenue per peripheral unit in Japan. Further discussion relating to\nfactors contributing to the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be\nfound in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading \"Global Market\nRisks\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and\nFinancial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \n    Domestic net sales declined 24% in the fourth quarter of 1997 over the\ncomparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh computers\nand peripheral products and in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit,\npartially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral\nunit.\n \n                                       11\n##PAGE\n    During the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the comparable period of\n1996, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer\nmarkets declined to 3.1% from 5.2%, and to 4.3% from 6.6%, respectively, based\nupon current market information provided by industry sources.\n \nQ4 97 COMPARED WITH Q3 97\n \n    Net sales decreased 7% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third\nquarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 8% in the fourth\nquarter of 1997 compared with the prior quarter which the Company believes was\ndue principally to continued customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic\ndirection, financial condition and future prospects, and the viability of the\nMacintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace, as well as\ncontinued easing of pent-up demand for new PowerBook products which were\nintroduced in the second quarter. In addition, unit sales in Japan decreased\nsignificantly in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of\n1997, primarily as a result of a weaker personal computer market. Unit sales of\nperipheral products decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared\nwith the third quarter of 1997. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh\ncomputer unit remained constant as higher average aggregate revenue per \"Value\"\n(entry level Power Macintosh) unit was offset by a lower average aggregate\nrevenue per Powerbook unit and aggressive pricing on discontinued products. The\naverage aggregate revenue per peripheral unit decreased 5% in the fourth quarter\nof 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997. Furthermore, the average\naggregate revenue per Macintosh computer and peripheral unit was unfavorably\naffected by pricing actions, including increased rebates, across most product\nlines.\n \n    International net sales represented 42% of total net sales in the fourth\nquarter of 1997, compared with 53% in the third quarter of 1997. International\nnet sales decreased 27% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of\n1997, primarily as a result of a significant decrease in net sales of Macintosh\ncomputers and peripheral products in Japan and a decrease in the average\naggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the\naverage aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. Further discussion relating to\nfactors contributing to the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be\nfound in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading \"Global Market\nRisks\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and\nFinancial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \n    Domestic net sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with\nthe prior quarter, due to increases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and\nthe average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, which increases were\nslightly offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral\nunit.\n \n    During the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997,\nthe Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer\nmarkets decreased to 3.1% from 3.7%, and to 4.3% from 4.7%, respectively, based\nupon current market information provided by industry sources.\n \nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 1996 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995\n \n    Net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,\ndecreasing $1,229 million, or 11%; $1,545 million, or 19%; and $682 million, or\n23%; during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods in 1995, due to a decrease in net\nsales of Macintosh computers and of peripheral products. Total Macintosh\ncomputer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,\ndecreasing 11%, 19%, and 26% during the twelve, nine, and three months ended\nSeptember 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995. This\ndecline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack of growth in worldwide\ndemand for all product families, which the Company believes was due principally\nto customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial\ncondition, and future prospects, and due to delays in the shipment of certain\nPowerBook products as a result of quality problems. In addition, unit sales of\nperipheral products trended\n \n                                       12\n##PAGE\ndownward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 20%, 24%, and 30%\nduring the twelve, nine and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively,\ncompared with the same periods in 1995, for the reasons noted above. The average\naggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and\nthree months ended September 27, 1996, and decreased slightly during the nine\nmonths ended September 27, 1996, compared with the same periods in 1995,\nprimarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the Company's newer\nproducts and products with multimedia configurations, offset to varying degrees\nby pricing actions across all product lines. The average aggregate revenue per\nperipheral product was flat during the twelve, nine, and three months ended\nSeptember 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.\n \n    International net sales represented 52% of net sales in 1996 compared with\n48% of net sales in 1995. International net sales trended downward beginning in\nthe second quarter of 1996, decreasing 3%, 11% and 13% during the twelve, nine,\nand three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same\nperiods in 1995. Net sales in European markets trended downward beginning in the\nsecond quarter of 1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months\nended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995, as a result of\na decrease in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, partially offset by an\nincrease in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit,\nprimarily during the first part of the year. Net sales in Japan trended downward\nbeginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and\nthree months ended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995. An\nincrease in Macintosh unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a\ndecrease in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit\nand a decrease in peripheral unit sales. Domestic net sales trended downward\nbeginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing by 18%, 26%, and 30% for the\ntwelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared\nwith the corresponding periods in 1995, resulting from a decline or lack of\ngrowth in demand for all product families.\n \n    In the fourth quarter of 1996 compared with the fourth quarter of 1995, the\nCompany's share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to\n5.4% from 8.7%, and to 7.3% from 13.2%, respectively, based on current\ninformation provided by industry sources.\n \nBACKLOG\n \n    In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed basis.\nResellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on\nchanging market conditions. Unfilled orders (backlog) can be, and often are,\ncanceled at will. The Company attempts to fill orders on the requested delivery\nschedules. However, products may be in relatively short supply from time to time\nuntil production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if\nother production or fulfillment constraints exist. The Company's backlog of\nunfilled orders decreased to approximately $230 million at November 28, 1997\nfrom approximately $563 million at November 29, 1996 and consisted primarily of\nthe Company's \"Flagship\" line of higher-end Power Macintosh products. The\nCompany's backlog at November 29, 1996 consisted primarily of the Company's\nPowerBook products, as well as the Company's \"Flagship\" line of higher-end Power\nMacintosh products. The Company expects that substantially all of its orders in\nbacklog at November 28, 1997 will be either shipped or canceled during fiscal\n1998.\n \n    In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.\nIn particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing introduction of new products because of overordering by dealers\nanticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as\nother factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered\na reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of\nrevenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's\nbacklog may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Product Introductions and Transitions\" included under\n \n                                       13\n##PAGE\nthe heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \nGROSS MARGIN\n \n    Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and\nits cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated per unit sold is\ninfluenced by the price set by the Company for its products. The cost of goods\nsold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent,\ndirect labor costs. The type and cost of components included in particular\nconfigurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk drives) are\noften directly related to the need to market products in configurations\ncompetitive with other manufacturers. Competition in the personal computer\nindustry is intense and, in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and\nproduct configuration are often necessary in order to remain competitive.\nAccordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly\ninfluenced in the short term by actions undertaken by the Company in response to\nindustrywide competitive pressures.\n \n    Gross margin increased from 10% to 19% of sales during 1997 compared to\n1996, primarily as a result of a $616 million charge in the second quarter of\n1996 that related principally to the write-down of certain inventory, as well as\nto the cost of cancelling excess component orders necessitated by significantly\nlower than expected demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its\n\"Value\" line of Power Macintosh products (formerly generally referred to as\nentry level and Performa-Registered Trademark- products). The Company separately\nincurred approximately $145 million in charges during 1996 to provide for the\nestimated costs of correcting certain quality problems in certain of its \"Value\"\nline of Power Macintosh products, as well as PowerBook and peripheral products,\ncovering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods. In addition, gross\nmargins in the second quarter of 1996, and to a lesser degree the first quarter\nof that year, were adversely affected by aggressive pricing actions in Japan in\nresponse to extreme competitive actions by other companies, as well as price\nreductions in the United States and Europe across all product lines in order to\nstimulate demand.\n \n    Gross margin decreased from 22% to 20% of sales during the fourth quarter of\n1997 compared to the same period of 1996, and remained constant compared to the\nthird quarter of 1997. This was primarily as a result of certain pricing actions\neffected by the Company as noted above, as well as the Company's inability to\nfulfill all purchase orders of certain high-margin Power Macintosh product due\nto the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain components, which were\noffset to varying degrees by sales of the Company's new operating system, Mac OS\n8, during the fourth quarter of 1997.\n \n    The gross margin levels in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the\nthird quarter of 1997 and the fourth quarter of 1996, and in 1997 compared with\n1996, were also adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain\nforeign currencies. This negative impact was offset by currency hedging. The\nCompany's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange\nrates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be\nsignificantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates.\n \n    There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the gross\nmargin levels achieved in 1997. Gross margins will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industrywide\nglobal pricing pressures, increased competition, and compressed product life\ncycles. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will\ncontinue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. The Company\nexpects to experience additional pricing pressure through at least the first\nfiscal quarter of 1998 as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS\nlicensing program, including the acquisition of its Mac OS license and other\nassets of Power Computing Corporation (\"PCC\"), as the Company expects certain\nMac OS licensees to sell aggressively their remaining inventory in early fiscal\n1998. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to\n \n                                       14\n##PAGE\neffectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand\nfor certain of its products.\n \n    Gross margin decreased to 10% in 1996 compared with 26% in 1995. This\ndecrease is primarily the result of a $616 million charge in the second quarter\nof 1996 for the write-down of certain inventory, as well as the costs of\ncancelling excess component orders, necessitated by significantly lower than\nexpected demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its entry-level\nproducts. The Company separately incurred approximately $145 million in charges\nduring the last nine months of 1996 to provide for the estimated costs of\ncorrecting certain quality problems in certain of the \"Value\" line of Power\nMacintosh products as well as PowerBook and peripheral products, covering both\ngoods held in inventory and shipped goods. The Company also incurred greater\nwarranty expenses per unit sold during 1996 compared with 1995. The decrease in\ngross margin was also due to the Company's response to extreme competitive\nactions by other companies attempting to gain market share, including the\nCompany's pricing actions in the U.S., Japan and Europe across most product\nlines, which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product\ncomponents.\n \nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n \n\n\n                                                                     1997       CHANGE       1996        CHANGE        1995\n                                                                   ---------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------\n                                                                                                      \nResearch and development.........................................  $     485         (20%) $     604           (2%)  $     614\n  Percentage of net sales........................................         7%                       6%                        6%\n\n \n    Research and development expenditures decreased in dollar amounts in 1997\nwhen compared with 1996, primarily due to certain restructuring actions,\nincluding a reduction in headcount and the cancellation of certain research and\ndevelopment related contracts, taken during 1997. The increase in research and\ndevelopment expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in\nthe level of net sales. There was a slight decrease in research and development\nexpenditures during 1996 compared with 1995. The slight increase as a percentage\nof net sales in 1996 over 1995 was the result of a decrease in net sales during\n1996.\n \n    The Company believes that continued and focused investments in research and\ndevelopment are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the\nmarketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new and\nenhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The\nCompany believes that research and development expenditures will decrease in\n1998 compared to 1997 as the Company completes and more fully realizes the cost\nreduction benefits of its restructuring plan.\n \n    Information relating to in-process research and development may be found in\nthis Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading \"In-process Research and\nDevelopment\" included under the heading \"Special Charges,\" which information is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\n \nSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n \n\n\n                                                                1997       CHANGE       1996        CHANGE        1995\n                                                              ---------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------\n                                                                                                 \nSelling, general and administrative.........................  $   1,286         (18%) $   1,568           (1%)  $   1,583\n  Percentage of net sales...................................        18%                      16%                       14%\n\n \n    Selling, general and administrative expenditures decreased in dollar amounts\nin 1997 when compared to 1996, primarily due to certain restructuring actions,\nincluding a reduction in headcount, the closing of facilities, and the writedown\nof assets, taken during 1997, and to lower variable expenses. The increase in\nselling, general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales\nresulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. In 1996, selling, general\nand administrative expenditures remained essentially flat when\n \n                                       15\n##PAGE\ncompared to 1995. The increase as a percentage of net sales in 1996 over 1995\nwas the result of a decrease in net sales during 1996.\n \n    The Company believes that selling, general and administrative expenditures\nwill decrease in 1998 compared to 1997 as the Company completes and more fully\nrealizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan. The Company\nbelieves that selling, general and administrative expenditures will decrease\nonly slightly in the first quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth quarter of\n1997 as a result of continued cost reduction benefits from the restructuring\nplan, partially offset by planned advertising spending.\n \nSPECIAL CHARGES\n \nIN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n \n    As a result of the NeXT acquisition, the Company took a substantial charge\nfor in-process research and development during 1997.

Interest and other\nincome (expense), net, also decreased compared to the prior year due to\ndecreased foreign exchange gains, net of cost, in 1997 compared to 1996,\npartially offset by higher average cash balances during 1997. Over the last two\nyears, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to non-investment grade.\nThe Company's cost of funds may increase as a result of the downgrading in the\nsecond quarter of 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term debt to B3 and\nCaa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services, and the downgrading in October\n1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term debt to B- and CCC, respectively,\nby Standard and Poor's Rating Agency.\n \n                                       16\n##PAGE\n    In 1996, interest and other income (expense), net, increased to $88 million\nin income from $10 million in expense in 1995. This $98 million favorable change\nwas primarily composed of a favorable variance of $78 million related to net\nrealized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains and lower foreign\nexchange hedging costs, primarily as a result of lower market and option\nvolatility, higher U.S. interest rates compared with rates abroad, and reduced\nforeign currency cash flows; an increase of $73 million related to realized\ngains on the sale of most of the Company's available-for-sale and other equity\nsecurities during 1996, partially offset by a $52 million unfavorable variance,\nas a result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances\nduring 1996, and an overall decline in average interest rate yields.\n \n    A summary of the Company's interest and other income (expense), net, hedge\nhorizons and accounting for financial instruments, and notes payable to banks\nand long-term debt, may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nPROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES\n \n    As of September 26, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from\ndeductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $695 million\nbefore being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on\nthe Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable\nbased on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. In 1997, an\nincrease in the valuation allowance of $208 million was recorded against the\ndeferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be realized.\nRealization of approximately $85 million of the asset representing tax loss and\ncredit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to generate\napproximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management believes\nthat it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, including income\nthat may be generated as a result of certain tax-planning strategies, will be\nsufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration in 2011\nand 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, there can be no assurance that\nthe Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the\namount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the\nnear and long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such\nan occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nThe Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax\nassets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation\nallowance. Additional information relating to income taxes, may be found in Part\nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n \nRESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS\n \n    During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring actions\naimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and\nrestoring sustainable profitability. During 1997, the Company announced and\nbegan to implement supplemental restructuring actions, including significant\nheadcount reductions, to meet the foregoing objectives. There are several risks\ninherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These\ninclude the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures\nquickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk that\ncost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and\nremain competitive in the computer industry.\n \n    Implementation of this restructuring involves several risks, including the\nrisk that by simplifying and modifying its product line the Company will\nincrease its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall sales, and\nincrease its reliance on unproven products and technology. Another risk of the\nrestructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the Company's products to\nbe manufactured under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose control\nof the quality or quantity of the products manufactured and distributed, or lose\nthe flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules in order to\nrespond to changing market conditions. As part of its restructuring, the Company\nannounced and\n \n                                       17\n##PAGE\nopened its on-line store, which makes available most of its products to\nend-users in the U.S., in November 1997. There can be no assurance the on-line\nstore will result in greater sales. The Company also began manufacturing\nproducts on a build-to-order basis in November 1997. There can be no assurance\nthis manufacturing process will result in decreased costs or increased gross\nmargins. The Company is also reducing the number of wholesale and retail channel\npartners, particularly in the Americas, which places a greater volume of sales\nthrough fewer partners. There can be no assurance that this will not adversely\nimpact the Company. In addition, the actions taken in connection with the\nrestructuring could adversely affect employee morale, thereby damaging the\nCompany's ability to retain and motivate employees. Also, because the Company\ncontemplates relying to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing\narrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control over\ncertain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to create\ninnovative new products may be reduced. In addition, there can be no assurance\nthat the technologies acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that\nkey NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated\nwith those at Apple. Also, the restructuring includes the winding down of the\nCompany's Mac OS licensing program. There can be no assurance that the winding\ndown of this program will result in greater sales, market share, and increased\ngross margins to the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that this\naction will not result in the availability of fewer application software titles\nfor the Mac OS, which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market\nshare and gross margins. Finally, even if the restructuring is successfully\nimplemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the\nvarious issues currently facing the Company. Although the Company believes that\nthe actions it is taking in connection with the restructuring, including its\nacquisition of NeXT and the winding down of its Mac OS licensing program, should\nhelp restore marketplace confidence in the Company, there can be no assurance\nthat such actions will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing\nits cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable\nprofitability. The Company's future consolidated operating results and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in\neffectively managing the restructuring and new cost structure.\n \n    Additional information relating to the restructuring of operations may be\nfound in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated\nFinancial Statements under the subheading \"Restructuring of Operations\" included\nunder the heading \"Special Charges,\" which information is hereby incorporated by\nreference.\n \nPRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS\n \n    Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which\nis characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological\nadvances, the Company must continuously introduce new products and technologies\nand enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. Recent\nintroductions include certain PowerBook and Power Macintosh products, and the\nintroduction of Mac OS 8 in July 1997. The success of new product introductions\nis dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's\nability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the\navailability of application software for new products, the effective management\nof inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of\nproducts in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that\nnew products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of\nintroduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that\nnew products will have on its sales or results of operations. In addition,\nalthough the number of new product introductions may decrease as a result of the\nCompany's restructuring actions, the risks and uncertainties associated with new\nproduct introductions may increase as the Company refocuses its product\nofferings on key growth segments and to the extent new product introductions are\nin markets that are new to the Company.\n \n    The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new\nproduct is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for\nthat product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not under the\ncontrol of the Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by a\n \n                                       18\n##PAGE\nsmall segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology prior\nto its acceptance by the majority of users (\"early adopters\"); purchases in\nsatisfaction of pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, as a\nresult, deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers who\nanticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. These factors may be\noffset by others, such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new\ntechnology is accepted as \"proven\" and for which commonly used software products\nare available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can\nobtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog.\n \n    Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the\naforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with introduction,\nand then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain\nsufficient supply of the new products. The Company has in the past experienced\ndifficulty in anticipating demand for new products, resulting in product\nshortages which have adversely affected the Company's operating results.\n \n    The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further\ncomplicated by the availability of different product configurations, which may\ninclude various types of built-in peripherals and software. Configurations may\nalso require certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, as\na result, demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the\navailability of third-party software in those localized versions. For example,\nthe availability of European-language versions of software products manufactured\nby U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter\nor more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products\noutside the U.S., even though localized versions of the Company's products may\nbe available.\n \n    The increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and complexity of\noperations of the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects\nor other faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of\nproducts have been produced or shipped. If such defects were significant, the\nCompany could incur material recall and replacement costs under product\nwarranties.\n \n    The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. The Company plans\nto continue to introduce major upgrades to the current Mac OS and later\nintroduce a new operating system (code named \"Rhapsody\") which is expected to\noffer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies.\nHowever, the NeXT software technologies that the Company plans to use in the\ndevelopment of Rhapsody were not originally designed to be compatible with the\nMac OS. As a result, there can be no assurance that the development of Rhapsody\ncan be completed at reasonable cost or at all. In addition, Rhapsody may not be\nfully backward-compatible with all existing applications, which could result in\na loss of existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody or the\nplanned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain developer support and\nmarket acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of\na substantially backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to the\ncurrent Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market acceptance for those\noperating systems, may have an adverse impact on the Company's consolidated\noperating results and financial condition.\n \nCOMPETITION\n \n    The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by\naggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\nintroduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement\nin product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of\nconsumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's consolidated results\nof operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue\nto be, adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward\npressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid\ntechnological advances in software functionality and hardware performance and\nfeatures based on existing or emerging industry standards. Many of the Company's\ncompetitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological\nresources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases\nthan those of the Company.\n \n                                       19\n##PAGE\n    The Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition\nmay be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer\npreferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over\nanother.\n \n    The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Mac OS.\nThe Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is\ndominated by makers of computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows\nNT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived\nadvantages over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed\nbase to incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind\nsales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past several years.\nRecent innovations in the Windows platform, including those included in Windows\n95 and Windows NT, or those expected to be included in a new version of Windows\nto be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows platform that make\nthe differences between the Mac OS and Microsoft's Windows operating systems\nless significant. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take\nsteps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal\ncomputer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition will be\nsubstantially dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements of\nthe Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional advantages over\ncompeting platforms.\n \n    The Company had previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to\nother personal computer vendors (the \"Clone Vendors\") as part of an effort to\nincrease the installed base for the Macintosh platform. The Company recently\ndetermined that the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under\nthese agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing\nprogram. As a result, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets, including\nthe license to distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a Clone Vendor, and has no plans\nto renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements. Although the Company believes\nthat this winding down of its licensing program will help reduce the adverse\nimpact of the licensing program on the Company's sales, market share and gross\nmargins, there can be no assurance that this will occur. In addition, there can\nbe no assurance that this winding down of the licensing program will not result\nin the availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, which\nmay result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross margins.\n \n    As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from Windows and other\nplatforms, the Company had previously devoted substantial resources toward\ndeveloping personal computer products capable of running application software\ndesigned for the Windows operating systems. These products include an add-on\ncard containing a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor that enables users to run\napplications concurrently that require the Mac OS, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95\noperating systems. The Company plans to transition the cross-platform business\nto third-parties during 1998. There can be no assurance that this transition\nwill be successful.\n \n    The Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Motorola, Inc.\nhad agreed upon and announced the availability of specifications for a PowerPC\nmicroprocessor-based hardware platform (the \"Platform\"). These specifications\ndefined a \"unified\" personal computer architecture that would have given the\nClone Vendors broad access to the Power Macintosh platform and would have\nutilized standard industry components. The Company had intended to license the\nMac OS to manufacturers of the Platform. However, the Company has decided it\nwill no longer support the Platform based upon its decision to wind down its Mac\nOS licensing program, and because of little industry support for the Platform.\nThe decision not to further develop this Platform may affect the Company's\nability to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.\n \n    Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their\nintention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including\neducation and publishing. Many of these companies have greater financial,\nmarketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.\n \n                                       20\n##PAGE\n    In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into patent cross\nlicensing and technology agreements. Under these agreements, the companies\nprovided patent cross licenses to each other. In addition, for a period of five\nyears from August 1997, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft\nOffice and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the Company will\nbundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and\nmake that product the default Internet browser for such releases. In addition,\nMicrosoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' non-voting convertible\npreferred stock for $150 million. While the Company believes that its\nrelationship with Microsoft will be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts\nto increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for\na limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company\ncompetes with Microsoft, including the Windows platform. In addition, the\nMicrosoft relationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the\nCompany's relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that the\nbenefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the\ndisadvantages.\n \nSUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS\n \n    Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as\nopposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of\nthird-party software for particular applications. The Company believes that the\navailability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware\nproducts depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of\nthe relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software\nfor the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This\nanalysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and\nits products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the\ncosts of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's recent\nfinancial losses and declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the\nCompany's decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, have caused\nsoftware developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer\nmarket, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or\nupgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows\nmarket. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce a new operating system\n(code named \"Rhapsody\") could cause software developers to stop developing\nsoftware for the current Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance that\nsoftware developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system\non a timely basis or at all.\n \n    Microsoft is an important developer of application software for the\nCompany's products. Although the Company has entered into a relationship with\nMicrosoft, which includes Microsoft's agreement to develop and ship future\nversions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products and certain\nother Microsoft tools for the Mac OS, such relationship is for a limited term\nand does not cover many areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft.\nAccordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac\nOS not covered by the relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be\ninfluenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the\nWindows operating system.\n \nGLOBAL MARKET RISKS\n \n    A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international\noperations. As a result, the Company's consolidated operations and financial\nresults could be significantly affected by risks associated with international\nactivities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax\nlaws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold.\n \n    Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have recently\nexperienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These\nweaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the Company's product, the\nU.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales, the\n \n                                       21\n##PAGE\navailability and supply of product components to the Company, and ultimately the\nCompany's consolidated results of operations.\n \n    When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar\nvalue of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens,\nthe U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly,\nthe U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S.\ndollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, the\nCompany is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such,\nbenefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar\nrelative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates,\nand in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the\nCompany's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars).\n \n    While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest\nrates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's\ninterest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general\nlevel of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates\naffect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and\nshort-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.\nTo mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has\nentered into interest rate swap, collar, and floor transactions.\n \n    To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange\nand interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and\nopportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its\nforeign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap,\noption and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with\nits underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related exposures,\nrespectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However,\ngiven the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities, there\ncan be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a\nportion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in\neither foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the\naccounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market\ninstruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and\nlosses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may\nadversely affect the Company's consolidated operating results and financial\nposition. The Company does not engage in leveraged hedging.\n \n    The Company's current financial condition may increase the costs of its\nhedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the hedging transactions\ninto which the Company's counterparties are willing to enter.\n \n    Additional information regarding the Company's foreign exchange and interest\nrate risk management programs and the accounting thereon, may be found in Part\nII, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nINVENTORY AND SUPPLY\n \n    The Company makes a provision for inventories of products that have become\nobsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for any cancellation\nfees of orders for inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the\nestimated costs to correct any product quality problems. Although the Company\nbelieves its inventory and related provisions are adequate given the rapid and\nunpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no\nassurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and\nrelated charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a\nmaterial effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of\noperations.\n \n    The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well\nin advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk that the Company\nwill forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of\nparticular products. The Company's consolidated operating results and financial\ncondition have been in\n \n                                       22\n##PAGE\nthe past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's\nability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in\ncustomer demand patterns.\n \n    Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by\nthird-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the\nCompany or otherwise. As part of its restructuring actions, the Company sold its\nFountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI and entered into a related\nmanufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its Singapore printed circuit\nboard manufacturing assets to NatSteel Electronics Pte., Ltd., which is expected\nto supply main logic boards to the Company under a manufacturing outsourcing\nagreement; entered into an agreement with Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. to\noutsource the Company's domestic operations transportation and logistics\nmanagement; and has entered into other similar agreements to outsource the\nCompany's European operations transportation and logistics management. As a\nresult of the foregoing actions, the proportion of the Company's products\nproduced and distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to\nincrease. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations,\nthey will also reduce the direct control the Company has over production and\ndistribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on\nthe quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the\nCompany to respond to changing market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by\nthe Company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject\nthe Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement. Moreover,\nalthough arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for\nwarranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially\nresponsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. Accordingly, in the\nevent of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain primarily\nliable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant\nto arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect\nthe Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition.\n \n    Although certain components essential to the Company's business are\ngenerally available from multiple sources, other key components (including\nmicroprocessors and application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are\ncurrently obtained by the Company from single sources. If the supply of a key\nsingle-sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed, the Company's business\nand financial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time\nrequired to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to\nidentify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The Company\nbelieves that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry\nof microprocessors and ASICs presents the most significant potential for\nconstraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced\nmicroprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and\nthus have limited availability. The Company and other producers in the personal\ncomputer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other\nindustries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to\neither increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their\nproducts (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the\nCompany uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal\ncomputer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued\navailability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components\ncustomized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product supply constraints\nand corresponding increased costs could decrease the Company's net sales and\nadversely affect the Company's consolidated operating results and financial\ncondition.\n \n    The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also\ndependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of\nthe PowerPC RISC microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to supply\nto Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce superior\nprice/performance results compared with those supplied to the Company's\ncompetitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers of the\nmicroprocessors used by most personal computers using the Windows operating\nsystems. The desire of IBM and Motorola to continue producing these\nmicroprocessors may be influenced by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its\nWindows NT operating\n \n                                       23\n##PAGE\nsystem software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. IBM produces personal\ncomputers based on Intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the\nPowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating\nsystem to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the\nCompany with microprocessors for the Company's products may be influenced by\nIBM's perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal\ncomputers and as a competing operating system vendor. In addition, Motorola has\nrecently announced its intention to stop producing Mac clones. As a result,\nMotorola may be less inclined to continue to produce PowerPC microprocessors.\n \n    The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties related to\nrecent events could affect the terms on which suppliers are willing to supply\nthe Company with their products. There can be no assurance that the Company's\ncurrent suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms acceptable to the\nCompany or that the Company will be able to obtain comparable products from\nalternate sources on such terms. The Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to\ncontinue to obtain key components on terms substantially similar to those\ncurrently available to the Company.\n \n    Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and\nproduct may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Raw\nMaterials,\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements under the subheading \"Concentrations in the\nAvailable Sources of Supply and Material Product\" included under the heading\n\"Concentrations of Risk\" and under the subheading \"Purchase Commitments\"\nincluded under the heading \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" which information is\nhereby incorporated by reference.\n \nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\n \n    A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the\nCompany's products. Currently, the Company distributes its products through\nwholesalers, resellers, mass merchants, cataloguers and direct to education\ninstitutions (collectively referred to as \"resellers\"). In addition, in November\n1997 the Company began selling many of its products directly to end users in the\nU.S. through the Company's on-line store. Many of the Company's significant\nresellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers also distribute\nproducts from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial\nresults could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these\nresellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not\nto continue to distribute the Company's products.\n \n    Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may continue to cause\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. In\naddition, the Company has in the past and may in the future experience delays in\nordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for the Company's products.\nUnder the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option\nto reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances\nwithout financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to return products to\nthe Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they may be\nassessed fees. The Company has recently revised its channel program, including\ndecreasing the number of resellers and reducing returns, price protection and\ncertain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel inventory, increase\ninventory turns, increase product support within the channel and improve gross\nmargins. In addition, in November 1997 the Company opened its on-line store in\nthe U.S. which makes many of the Company's products available directly to the\nend-user. Although the Company believes the foregoing changes will improve its\nconsolidated operating results and financial condition, there can be no\nassurance that this will occur.\n \n    Further discussion relating to Marketing and Distribution may be found in\nPart I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Markets and Distribution,\"\nwhich information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n \n                                       24\n##PAGE\nCHANGE IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT\n \n    On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio had\nresigned his positions as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and\nthat the Company was initiating a search for a new Chief Executive Officer.\nWhile the Company intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as\npracticable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior management and\nrelated uncertainties will not adversely affect the Company's consolidated\noperating results and financial condition during the period until a new Chief\nExecutive Officer is hired and afterward. In addition, certain members of the\nCompany's senior management have been with the Company for less than six months.\nThere can be no assurance that new members of the management team can be\nsuccessfully assimilated, that the Company will be able to satisfactorily\nallocate responsibilities or that such new members of its management will\nsucceed in their roles in a timely and efficient manner. The Company's failure\nto recruit, retain and assimilate new executives, or the failure of any such\nexecutive to perform effectively, or the loss of any such executive, could have\na material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n \nCHANGES TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n \n    The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant changes to its Board of\nDirectors, replacing all but two former directors. The continuing directors are\nGareth C.C. Chang, Corporate Senior Vice President, Marketing, Hughes\nElectronics and President, Hughes International, and Edgar S. Woolard, Jr.,\nretired Chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company. The new directors are\nWilliam V. Campbell, President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence J. Ellison,\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oracle Corp.; Steven P. Jobs, Chairman\nand Chief Executive Officer of Pixar Animation Studios; and Jerome B. York, Vice\nChairman of Tracinda Corporation and former Chief Financial Officer of IBM and\nChrysler Corporation.\n \nDEPENDENCE ON KEY EMPLOYEES\n \n    During the past several years, the Company has experienced significant\nvoluntary employee turnover as a result of employees' concerns over the\nCompany's prospects, as well as the abundance of career opportunities available\nelsewhere. The Company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve its\nbusiness plan. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to attract,\nmotivate and retain key employees. Failure to do so may have a significant\neffect on the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition.\n \nOTHER FACTORS\n \n    The Company is in the process of identifying operating and application\nsoftware challenges related to the year 2000. While the Company expects to\nresolve year 2000 compliance issues substantially through normal replacement and\nupgrades of software, there can be no assurance that there will not be\ninterruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that\nthe Company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations. Any\nfailure to effectively monitor, implement or improve the Company's operational,\nfinancial, management and technical support systems could have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's business and consolidated results of operations.\n \n    The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its\ncorporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including\ncertain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's\noperating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected\nin the event of a major earthquake.\n \n    Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may\nsubject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, in\nsome instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the\nability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and\nleave\n \n                                       25\n##PAGE\nresponsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company.\nIt is unclear what effect such regulations will have on the Company's future\nconsolidated operating results and financial condition.\n \n    The Company recently decided to replace its existing transaction systems in\nthe U.S. (which include order management, product procurement, distribution, and\nfinance) with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort to\nincrease operational efficiency. Substantially all of the transaction systems in\nthe European operations were replaced with the same integrated system in 1997.\nThe Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition\ncould be adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and\neffectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.\n \n    Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the\nCompany's consolidated operating results and financial condition, past financial\nperformance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future\nperformance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate\nresults or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation in\na highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the\nCompany's common stock price.\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \n    The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks,\ndecreased to $1,434 million as of September 26, 1997, from $1,559 million as of\nSeptember 27, 1996. The Company's consolidated financial position with respect\nto cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased to $1,459\nmillion as of September 26, 1997, from $1,745 million as of September 27, 1996.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 26, 1997 and\nSeptember 27, 1996 include $165 million and $177 million, respectively, pledged\nas collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the\nCompany's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's\nFountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI.\n \n    Cash generated by operations during 1997 totaled $188 million. Cash\ngenerated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in accounts\nreceivable and inventories, partially offset by the Company's net loss, adjusted\nfor non-cash expenditures such as in-process research and development, as well\nas decreases in accounts payable.\n \n    Cash used to acquire NeXT totaled $384 million in 1997. The Company expects\nno additional cash expenditures related to the NeXT acquisition. Net cash used\nfor the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $53 million in 1997,\nand consisted primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment.\nThe Company expects that the level of capital expenditures in 1998 will be\ncomparable to 1997.\n \n    Cash generated by financing activities in 1997 included the sale of $150\nmillion of Apple Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock to Microsoft\nCorporation. Cash used by financing activities in 1997 included $161 million to\nretire notes payable to banks.\n \n    Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to\nnon-investment grade. In October 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated\nlong-term debt were downgraded to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and\nPoor's Rating Agency. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's debt ratings\nwere downgraded to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services. Both\nStandard and Poor's Rating Agency and Moody's Investor Services have the Company\non negative outlook. These actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in\nfuture periods. In addition, the Company may be required to pledge additional\ncollateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and\nto agree to more stringent covenants than in the past.\n \n    The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and\nshort-term investments, and continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be\nsufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months. Expected\ncash requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated $130 million\nto effect actions under the restructuring plan, most of which will be effected\nduring the first half of fiscal\n \n                                       26\n##PAGE\n1998. No assurance can be given that the $25 million in short-term borrowings\nfrom banks can be continued, or that any additional required financing could be\nobtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated\nor be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its\nliquidity, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially\nadversely affected.\n \n    The Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has proposed federal income tax\ndeficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain\nprepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing\npetitions with the U.S. Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now\nbeen resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the\nyears 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of the issues for these\nyears have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being\ncontested by the Company. Management believes that adequate provision has been\nmade for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\n \n                                       27\n##PAGE"}, "1999": {"item1": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\nGENERAL\n\nApple Computer, Inc.-Registered Trademark- (\"Apple\" or the \"Company\") was\nincorporated under the laws of the state of California on January 3, 1977. The\nCompany's principal executive offices are located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino,\nCalifornia, 95014, and its telephone number is (408) 996-1010.\n\nThe Company designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related\npersonal computing and communicating solutions for sale primarily to education,\ncreative, consumer, and business customers. Substantially all of the Company's\nnet sales to date have been derived from the sale of personal computers from its\nApple Macintosh-Registered Trademark- line of computers and related software and\nperipherals. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.\nThe Company's geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia\nPacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The\nEuropean segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and\nAfrica. The Japan segment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment\nincludes Australia and Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment\nprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further\ninformation regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II,\nItem 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Net Sales,\" and in Part II,  Item 8\non this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9,\n\"Segment Information and Geographic Data,\" which information is hereby\nincorporated by reference.\n\nDuring 1998, the Company continued and essentially completed a restructuring\nplan commenced in 1996 aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its\ncompetitiveness, and restoring sustainable profitability. The Company's\nrestructuring actions included the termination of employees, closure of\nfacilities, and cancellation of contracts. Further information regarding these\nrestructuring actions may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4, \"Special Charges,\" which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nPRINCIPAL HARDWARE PRODUCTS\n\nApple Macintosh personal computers were first introduced in 1984, and are\ncharacterized by their intuitive ease of use, innovative industrial designs and\napplications base, and built-in networking, graphics, and multimedia\ncapabilities. The Company offers a wide range of personal computing products,\nincluding personal computers, related peripherals, software, and networking and\nconnectivity products. All of the Company's Macintosh products employ\nPowerPC-Registered Trademark- RISC-based microprocessors.\n\nPOWER MACINTOSH-Registered Trademark-\n\nThe Power Macintosh line of high-performance personal computers is targeted at\nbusiness and professional users and is designed to meet the speed, expansion and\nnetworking needs of the most demanding Macintosh user. The Company's current\nline of Power Macintosh systems was introduced in August 1999 and is equipped\nwith PowerPC G4 processors. With the addition of Apple networking software,\nPower Macintosh systems can be used as workgroup servers.\n\nPOWERBOOK-Registered Trademark- G3\n\nThe PowerBook G3 family of portable computer products is specifically designed\nto meet the mobile computing needs of professionals and advanced personal users.\nIncorporating powerful PowerPC G3\n\n                                       1\n##PAGE\nprocessors, large active-matrix displays, long battery lives, and software\ndesigned to enhance mobile computing, the Company's PowerBook G3 family is\nintended to provide professional desktop performance in a notebook computer.\n\niMAC-Registered Trademark-\n\nOriginally announced in May 1998, the iMac computer is targeted at the education\nand consumer markets. With an innovative industrial design, easy Internet\naccess, and a powerful PowerPC G3 processor, iMac is suitable for a wide range\nof education and consumer applications. A completely redesigned iMac was\nintroduced in October 1999 and is available in three models: iMac, iMac\nDV-Registered Trademark- (Digital Video), and iMac DV Special Edition. Both DV\nmodels feature Firewire ports, DVD drives, and the Company's simple-to-use\niMovie-TM- digital video editing software.\n\niBOOK-TM-\n\nThe iBook computer, intended to be the \"iMac to Go,\" was introduced in\nJuly 1999. Designed specifically for the portable computing needs of education\nand consumer users, the iBook features a large active-matrix display, long\nbattery life, a PowerPC G3 processor, Internet-ready hardware and software\nconfigurations, and built-in antennas for optional AirPort-TM- wireless\nnetworking capability.\n\nPERIPHERAL PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company sells certain associated computer peripherals, including a range of\nhigh quality precision color monitors and AirPort wireless networking base\nstations and add-in cards. Over the past three years, the Company eliminated all\nof its Apple-branded printers and significantly reduced the number of its\nmonitor products. The Company also discontinued its\nMessagePad-Registered Trademark- and eMate-Registered Trademark- product lines.\nThe discontinuance of these peripheral products and portable computing products\nwas part of the overall strategy by the Company to simplify and focus its\nefforts on those products perceived as critical to the Company's future success.\n\nPRINCIPAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS\n\nOPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE\n\nThe Company's operating system software, Mac-Registered Trademark- OS, provides\nMacintosh computers with an easy, consistent user interface. The current\nversion, Mac OS 9-Registered Trademark-, began shipping in October 1999 and\ndelivers Sherlock-TM- 2, the updated version of the Company's advanced Internet\nsearch engine. Mac OS 9 includes over 50 new features, including features for\nfaster and more efficient Internet usage, enhanced system and network security,\nand auto-updating of Apple software over the Internet. The Company plans to\ncontinue to introduce upgrades to Mac OS 9 and later to introduce the client\nversion of a new operating system, Mac OS X. Mac OS X Client is expected to\noffer advanced functionality based on software technologies of Apple and those\nin-process technologies of NeXT-Registered Trademark- Software, Inc. (NeXT),\nwhich the Company acquired in 1997.\n\nIn March 1999, the Company introduced Mac OS X Server, which combines the\nstrength of UNIX-Registered Trademark- and simplicity of the Macintosh. Mac OS X\nServer is based on the Mach 2.5 microkernel and the BSD-Registered Trademark-\n4.4 operating system. It provides performance and stability through full\npreemptive multitasking, protected memory, and advanced virtual memory. NetBoot\nis a Mac OS X server feature allowing a network of Macs to be booted and\nconfigured from a single server. In March 1999, the Company also introduced\nDarwin, the Open Source release of the Mac OS X server foundation.\n\nThe Company has two primary digital video authoring/editing software titles.\nFinal Cut Pro-TM-, introduced in April 1999, is video authoring software that\ncombines professional-quality video editing, compositing, and special effects in\none package. iMovie, introduced in October 1999, makes it easy to create home\nand classroom movies. iMovie software comes pre-installed on all iMac DV and\niMac DV Special Edition models.\n\n                                       2\n##PAGE\nThe Company also develops and distributes extensions to the Macintosh system\nsoftware, such as utilities, languages, and developer tools. The Company\ncontinues to develop QuickTime-Registered Trademark-, its market-leading cross\nplatform digital media technology. WebObjects-Registered Trademark-, a leading\nsoftware product in the emerging application server market, is also part of\nApple's software portfolio. Targeted at Windows NT-Registered Trademark- and\nUNIX platforms, future versions will also run on Apple hardware.\nFileMaker-Registered Trademark- Corporation (formerly\nClaris-Registered Trademark- Corporation), a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany, develops, publishes, and distributes database management application\nsoftware for Mac OS and Windows-based systems. Further, the Company has\ndeveloped and currently markets AppleWorks-Registered Trademark- 5, formerly\nClarisWorks-Registered Trademark-, an integrated suite of software applications\nthat combines word processing, database, spreadsheet, drawing and communications\ncapabilities in a single software package for both Mac OS and Windows.\n\nINTERNET INTEGRATION\n\nApple's Internet strategy is focused on delivering seamless integration with and\naccess to the Internet throughout the Company's product lines. In addition to\nSherlock 2, an easy Internet Setup Assistant is an integral part of Mac OS 9,\nthe current version of the Macintosh operating system.\n\nTHIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS\n\nOver the past two years, particularly since the announcement of the iMac in\nMay 1998, software developers have demonstrated renewed interest in the\nMacintosh platform. Since iMac was announced, approximately 5,000 new or revised\nsoftware titles have been announced for the Macintosh platform. Additionally,\nMicrosoft delivered a new version of their productivity software--Office 98:\nMacintosh Edition--in early 1998.\n\nThe Company previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to other\npersonal computer vendors (the Clone Vendors) as part of an effort to increase\nthe installed base for the Macintosh platform. In fiscal 1997, the Company\ndetermined the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under these\nagreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing\nprogram. As a result, the Company discontinued the Mac OS licensing program and\nacquired certain assets of Power Computing Corporation (PCC), a Clone Vendor,\nincluding PCC's license to distribute the Mac OS. The Company does not currently\nplan general licensing of the Mac OS.\n\nFurther information regarding the Company's products may be found in Part II,\nItem 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Competition\" included under the\nheading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nMARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and\nbusiness markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh computers for a\nvariety of reasons, including the reduced amount of training resulting from the\nMacintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, industrial design features of the\nCompany's hardware products, the ability of Macintosh computers to network and\ncommunicate with other computer systems and environments, and the availability\nof a wide variety of certain user-friendly application software.\n\nApple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in the\nlate 1970s. In the United States, the Company is one of the major suppliers of\npersonal computers for both elementary and secondary school customers, as well\nas for college and university customers. The Company is also a supplier to\ninstitutions of higher education outside of the United States.\n\nThe United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. The\nUnited States is part of the Company's Americas operating segment, which has\nresponsibility for the Company's sales, marketing, and support efforts in North\nand South America. Approximately 45% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 1999\ncame from its international operations. Final assembly of products sold by the\nCompany is conducted\n\n                                       3\n##PAGE\nin the Company's manufacturing facilities in California, Singapore, and Cork,\nIreland, and by external vendors in Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, and the United\nKingdom.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national\nand regional retailers and cataloguers, and directly to education institutions\nfor resale (collectively referred to as \"resellers\"). The Company also sells\nmany of its products in most of its major markets directly to end users through\nits on-line store. Throughout fiscal 1998, the Company revised its distribution\nchannel model and related policies. As a result, the Company significantly\nreduced the number of its distributors, authorized resellers, and national\nretail channel partners, particularly in the United States. The Company also\nrevised its distribution channel policies including decreasing the price\nprotection and stock return privileges of its remaining distributors and\nresellers.\n\nRAW MATERIALS\n\nAlthough certain components essential to the Company's business are generally\navailable from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors\nand application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by\nthe Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components (including\nwithout limitation DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently\navailable to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry\nwide availability and pricing pressures. Any availability limitations,\ninterruption in supplies, or price increases relative to these and other\ncomponents could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.\nIn addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize\ncustom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated\nwhether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. In\nsituations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial\ncapacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have\nmatured. Components are normally acquired through purchase orders, as is common\nin the industry, typically covering the Company's requirements for periods from\n60 to 120 days. However, the Company continues to evaluate the need for a supply\ncontract in each situation.\n\nIf the supply of a key component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed\nor in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products\nto the Company, the Company's ability to ship products in desired quantities and\nin a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and\nfinancial performance could also be adversely affected, depending on the time\nrequired to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if\npossible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative\nsource. In addition to its current suppliers of DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel\ndisplays, the Company believes the component suppliers and manufacturing vendors\nwhose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the\nCompany's business and financial position include, at this time: Alpha-Top\nCorporation, Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc.,\nCanon, Inc., Darfon Electronics Corporation, IBM Corporation, LG Electronics,\nMatsushita, Motorola, Inc., NatSteel Electronics PTE Ltd., Philips\nSemiconductors, Quanta Computer, Inc., and Samsung Electronics. The Company\nattempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and\nother key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories,\ncoordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing\nschedules and levels. The Company believes many of its single-source suppliers,\nincluding most of the foregoing companies, are reliable multinational\ncorporations. The Company also believes most of these suppliers manufacture the\nrelevant components in multiple plants. The Company further believes its\nlong-standing business relationships with many of these and other key suppliers\nare strong and mutually beneficial in nature.\n\nThe Company has from time to time experienced significant price increases and\nlimited availability of certain components that are available from multiple\nsources. Any similar occurrences in the future could have an adverse effect on\nthe Company's operating results.\n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product\nmay be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Inventory and Supply\" included under the heading\n\n                                       4\n##PAGE\n\"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" and in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements at Note 8 under the subheading \"Concentrations in the Available\nSources of Supply of Materials and Product,\" which information is hereby\nincorporated by reference.\n\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES\n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain\naspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition,\nthe Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the\nUnited States and a number of foreign countries for\n\"Apple-Registered Trademark-\", the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple color logo,\n\"Macintosh-Registered Trademark-,\" and numerous other product trademarks. In\n1986, the Company acquired ownership of the trademark \"Macintosh\" for use in\nconnection with computer products. Although the Company believes the ownership\nof such patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses is an important factor in\nits business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof,\nthe Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and\nmarketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nBecause of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive\npatent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible\ncertain components of the Company's products may unknowingly infringe existing\npatents of others. The Company believes the resolution of any claim of\ninfringements would not have a material adverse effect on its financial\ncondition and results of operations as reported in the accompanying consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Company has from time to time entered into\ncross-licensing agreements with other companies.\n\nSEASONAL BUSINESS\n\nAlthough the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it\nhas historically experienced increased sales in its first and fourth fiscal\nquarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand\nrelated to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. However,\npast performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's\nfuture net sales or financial performance.\n\nWARRANTY\n\nThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products.\nThe warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end\nuser. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple software and for Apple\nservice parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may\npurchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the\nCompany's major markets.\n\nSIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS\n\nNo customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 1999,\n1998, or 1997.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.\nIn particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers\nanticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog\nshould not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to\nachieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for the design, manufacture, and sale of personal computers and\nrelated software and peripheral products is highly competitive. It continues to\nbe characterized by rapid technological advances\n\n                                       5\n##PAGE\nin both hardware and software development, which have substantially increased\nthe capabilities and applications of these products, and has resulted in the\nfrequent introduction of new products. The principal competitive factors in this\nmarket are relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design\ninnovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and\ndistribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware\nperipherals, and corporate reputation. The Company is currently taking and will\ncontinue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on\nits personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows\nplatform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are\nsubstantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to\nthe Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design\nadvantages over competing platforms.\n\nFurther discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal\ncomputing industry and the Company's competitive position in the marketplace may\nbe found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future\nResults and Financial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by\nreference.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nBecause the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological\nadvances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent\nupon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products\nand technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products\nand technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and\nperipherals, system software, networking and communications, and the Internet.\nThe Company's research and development expenditures, before charges for\nin-process research and development, totaled $314 million, $303 million, and\n$485 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The declines in total\nexpenditures for research and development in 1999 and 1998 as compared to 1997\nwere principally due to restructuring actions taken by the Company intended to\nfocus the Company's research and development efforts on those projects perceived\nas critical to the Company's future success.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS\n\nCompliance with federal, state, and local laws and foreign laws enacted for the\nprotection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the\nCompany's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

unit sales. This\nincrease is primarily attributable to the success of iMac, the Company's\nmoderately priced desktop Macintosh system designed for the education and\nconsumer markets. The Company sold approximately 1.8 million iMac units in 1999,\nan increase of approximately 730,000 units or 68% over unit sales of similar\nproducts in 1998. Growth in unit sales was strong in all of the Company's\ngeographic operating segments, particularly in Japan and Asia Pacific due to\nstrong acceptance of iMac in those regions and the general economic improvements\nexperienced in much of Asia during the year. The Company also experienced\nimproved profitability in 1999. Operating income before special charges rose 44%\nor $118 million to $386 million in 1999 from $268 million in 1998. Contributing\nto the improvement in operating margin in 1999 was a rise in gross margin as a\npercentage of net sales to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. The impact of\nimproved gross margins was partially offset by planned increases in recurring\noperating expenses during 1999 of 8% to a total of $1.337 billion.\n\nDespite improved unit sales and improved profitability, the Company's net sales\nrose only 3% in 1999 to $6.134 billion. Growth in net sales was negatively\nimpacted during the year by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system\nfor both Power Macintosh and iMac systems and by a shift in unit mix towards the\nlower priced iMac systems. Net sales were also negatively impacted during the\nfourth quarter of 1999 due to lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4\nprocessors from Motorola. The primary focus of the Company during fiscal 2000\nremains achieving meaningful year-over-year growth in both unit sales and net\nsales.\n\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent\nupon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market\ntechnologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions\nwithin the highly competitive market for personal computers. Potential risks and\nuncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition are discussed\n\n                                       10\n##PAGE\nthroughout this Item 7, including the discussion under the heading \"Factors That\nMay Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\"\n\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for geographic segments and Macintosh unit sales by geographic segment\nand by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in\nthousands):\n\n\n\n                                                      1999      CHANGE         1998      CHANGE         1997\n                                                    --------   --------      --------   --------      --------\n                                                                                       \nAmericas net sales................................   $3,527        2 %        $3,468       (5)%        $3,668\nEurope net sales..................................   $1,317        2 %        $1,295      (16)%        $1,536\nJapan net sales...................................   $  858       17 %        $  731      (33)%        $1,098\nAsia Pacific net sales............................   $  306        4 %        $  293      (38)%        $  472\n\nAmericas Macintosh unit sales.....................    2,021       22 %         1,655        6 %         1,568\nEurope Macintosh unit sales.......................      724       23 %           588       (2)%           601\nJapan Macintosh unit sales........................      524       35 %           389      (25)%           516\nAsia Pacific Macintosh unit sales.................      179       37 %           131      (31)%           189\n                                                     ------                   ------                   ------\n  Total Macintosh unit sales......................    3,448       25 %         2,763       (4)%         2,874\n                                                     ======                   ======                   ======\n\nPower Macintosh unit sales........................    1,296        2 %         1,266       29 %           981\nPowerBook unit sales..............................      344      (19)%           427        2 %           417\niMac unit sales(a)................................    1,802       68 %         1,070      (28)%         1,476\niBook unit sales..................................        6       --              --       --              --\n                                                     ------                   ------                   ------\n  Total Macintosh unit sales......................    3,448       25 %         2,763       (4)%         2,874\n                                                     ======                   ======                   ======\n\n\n- ------------------------\n\n(a) Unit sales figures for iMac in 1998 and 1997 include sales of the Company's\n    previous consumer and education oriented Macintosh products.\n\nNet sales increased $193 million or 3% to $6.134 billion in 1999 compared to\n1998. The primary source of this growth was an overall 25% increase in Macintosh\nunit sales, which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the Company's\ngeographic operating segments. Offsetting the rise in unit shipments was a\ndecline in the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net\nsales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, which\nfell 17% to $1,739 from $2,095 in 1998. The decline during 1999 in the average\nrevenue per Macintosh system is attributable to lower pricing for both iMac and\nPower Macintosh products, which reflects the continuing overall industry trend\ntowards lower pricing. The decline is also attributable to the shift in the\nCompany's unit mix toward lower-priced consumer products such that iMac units\nand comparable products comprised 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999\nversus 39% in 1998.\n\nNet sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to\nthe third quarter by $222 million or 14%, and declined $220 million or 14%\ncompared to the same period in 1998. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales declined\n15% and 7% during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter of\n1999 and the same period in 1998, respectively. The primary causes for these\ndeclines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of\nPowerPC G4 processors from Motorola and production interruptions at vendors\nsupplying PowerBooks and iBooks experienced during the last week of the fourth\nquarter of 1999 as a result of the earthquake in Taiwan on September 20, 1999.\nThe shortage of G4 processors reduced net sales by approximately $200 million\nduring the fourth quarter of 1999.\n\nNet sales decreased $1.140 billion, or 16%, to $5.941 billion in 1998 compared\nto 1997. The decline during 1998 in net sales is attributable to several\nfactors. The Company experienced a $454 million decrease in net sales of\nperipheral products during 1998 compared to 1997 principally due to the\ndiscontinuance by the\n\n                                       11\n##PAGE\nCompany of certain imaging and display products. The average revenue per\nMacintosh system fell 11% during 1998 as compared to 1997 from $2,375 to $2,095,\nreflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power Macintosh G3\nsystems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the decline in net sales\nfrom the phase out of certain peripheral products, the overall industry trend\ntoward lower priced products, and the Company's reentry during the fourth\nquarter of 1998 into the lower-priced consumer market. Lastly, overall Macintosh\nCPU unit sales for 1998 declined approximately 4% from 1997. International net\nsales were particularly affected by these factors and by the economic conditions\nexisting in Asia during 1998.\n\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's\ngeographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The\nAmericas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment\nincludes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan\nsegment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia\nand Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar\nhardware and software products and similar services. Further information\nregarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9,\n\"Segment Information and Geographic Data,\" which information is hereby\nincorporated by reference.\n\nAMERICAS\n\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased 2% to $3.527 billion during 1999 as\ncompared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 22%. This followed a 5%\ndecline in net sales in the Americas between 1998 and 1997. During 1999, the\nAmericas segment represented approximately 57% and 59% of the Company's total\nnet sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The results experienced\nby this segment in 1999 reflect the overall trends experienced by the Company of\ngrowing Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per\nMacintosh system.\n\nEUROPE\n\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased 2% to $1.317 billion during 1999 as\ncompared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 23%. This followed a 16%\ndecline in net sales in the Europe segment between 1998 and 1997. Like the\nAmericas segment, Europe's results in 1999 as compared to 1998 are indicative of\nstrong growth in Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue\nper Macintosh system.\n\nJAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC\n\nMacintosh unit sales and net sales in Asia, particularly in Japan, recovered\nduring 1999 from the declines experienced in 1998. Net sales in the Japan\nsegment increased 17% or $127 million to a total of $858 million in 1999 as\ncompared to 1998. Macintosh unit sales in Japan increased 35% during 1999\ncompared to 1998 while Macintosh unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment\nincreased 37%. The increases in net sales and Macintosh unit sales in both Japan\nand Asia Pacific are the result of strong iMac sales experienced by these\noperating segments, strong growth in Japanese consumer sales, and the general\neconomic recovery experienced in the region.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.\nIn particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing new product introductions because of overordering by dealers\nanticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog\nshould not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to\nachieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further\ninformation regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the\nsubheading \"Product Introductions and Transitions\"\n\n                                       12\n##PAGE\nincluded under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial\nCondition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nGROSS MARGIN\n\nGross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1999 to 28% as\ncompared to 25% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to declines in\nthe cost of various components of the Company's products, improvements in\nmanufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final\nassembly of certain of the Company's products, improved design of products\nleading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs, and relatively stable pricing\nof the Company's products over the last six months of 1999. During 1999, the\nCompany was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily\nin 1998 and 1997 that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient\ndistribution model for its products. These improvements are discussed below.\n\nGross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1998 to 25% compared\nto 19% in 1997. This increase was primarily the result of a shift in revenue mix\ntoward the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems and newer\nPowerBook G3 systems, the low volume of lower margin consumer products shipped\nduring the first three quarters of 1998, and the declining cost of various\ncomponents of the Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia.\nImprovements in the Company's inventory management also contributed to the\nincrease in gross margins. During 1998, the Company simplified its product line,\nmoving from approximately 15 separate individual products to three main product\nfamilies. Further, the Company attempted to use as many industry standard parts\nin its newer products as possible, expanded the use of supplier hubs at\nmanufacturing sites, and outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards\nand some systems assembly. These changes have allowed the Company to more\naccurately forecast demand, reduce inventory carrying levels and related costs,\nlessen the financial exposure resulting from inventory obsolescence and excess\ninventory levels, and reduce the component cost of obtaining certain\nstandardized parts. The Company also made changes to its distribution model\nduring 1998 and 1997 that contributed to the increase in gross margins in 1998.\nThe Company significantly reduced the number of locations where it stages\nfinished goods, generally holding inventory on a regional basis rather than in\neach country. Also, the Company significantly reduced the number of its\ndistributors, authorized resellers, and national retail channel partners,\nparticularly in the United States. These changes allowed the Company to reduce\ninventory and related financial exposures and reduced the inventory and related\nfinancial exposure associated with inventory held in the Company's distribution\nchannels. The Company has also revised its distribution channel policies by\ndecreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its distributors\nand resellers.\n\nThe Company anticipates that as lower priced consumer products become a larger\nshare of net sales and the overall industry trend toward lower-priced products\ncontinues, gross margins will decline during fiscal 2000. The foregoing\nstatement is forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ because\nof several factors, including those set forth in the following paragraph and\nbelow in the subsection entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and\nFinancial Condition.\"\n\nThere can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or\ncurrent margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general,\ngross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant\ndownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide\nglobal pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles,\npotential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside\nmanufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix,\nincluding higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling\nprices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the\nCompany expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its\nproducts. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to\neffectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand\nfor certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take\ninto account anticipated changes in foreign\n\n                                       13\n##PAGE\ncurrency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations\ncan be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange\nrates.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company recognizes focused investments in research and development are\ncritical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and\nare directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are\ncentral to the Company's core business strategy. Expenditures on research and\ndevelopment increased 4% or $11 million to $314 million in 1999 as compared to\n1998. This followed a $182 million or 38% decline in 1998 as compared to 1997.\nThe overall decline in spending on research and development over the last two\nyears is principally due to restructuring actions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998\nintended to focus the Company's research and development efforts on those\nprojects perceived as critical to the Company's future success. These\nrestructuring actions led to significant reductions in research and development\nrelated headcount and the cancellation of many research and development\nprojects.\n\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% to $996 million\nin 1999 as compared to 1998 and increased to 16% of net sales in 1999 from 15%\nin 1998. These increases are primarily the result of increased spending on\nmarketing and promotional activities throughout 1999 and a 12% increase in\ncombined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end\nof 1998 to the end of 1999.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenditures declined $378 million or 29%\nin 1998 compared to 1997 and declined to 15% of net sales in 1998 from 18% of\nnet sales in 1997. These decreases were primarily the result of restructuring\nactions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998, which resulted in reductions in\nheadcount, closing of facilities, and write-down and disposal of operating\nassets during 1996, 1997, and 1998. Additionally, changes during 1998 in the\nCompany's distribution channel policies and business model, including\ncontraction and focus of the Company's product line and simplification of the\nCompany's internal and external distribution channels, led to a reduction in\nselling expenses during 1998.\n\nSPECIAL CHARGES\n\n1996 AND 1997 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS\n\nIn the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a\nrestructuring plan designed to reduce costs and return the Company to\nprofitability. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for\nthe Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction.\nThese actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the\nCompany announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to\nmeet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a\n$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those\nactions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were\nessentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997\nrestructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time\nemployees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those\nemployee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be\nsold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational\nfunctions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not\ncritical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions\nunder the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $293 million and noncash asset\nwrite-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through\nSeptember 25, 1999. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of\n$396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the\nfourth quarter of 1999. The remaining balance of $5 million as of September 25,\n1999, in accrued restructuring costs for the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions\nis comprised of payments over the next two years on leases and contracts that\nhad been terminated prior to fiscal 1999. The Company expects the remaining\naccrual will result in cash expenditures of $5 million over the next two years.\n\n                                       14\n##PAGE\n1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting in a charge to operations of $21 million. The net restructuring charge\nof $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects the\n$3 million of excess reserves related to the 1996 and 1997 restructuring\nactions. The total cost of these actions of $21 million is comprised of\n$11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the\nCompany's outsourced data center and $10 million for contract cancellation\ncharges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued.\nThe Company expects these actions to result in cash expenditures of $21 million\nover the next year.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve\nthe flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final\nassembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These\nrestructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations\nof approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999, which was\ncomprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees\ninvoluntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to\nbe disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions\nresulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees and are substantially\ncomplete as of September 25, 1999.\n\nIN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development\nand had no alternative future use. The acquisition resulted in the recognition\nof $7 million of purchased in-process research and development, which was\ncharged to operations upon acquisition.\n\nIn February 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of NeXT\nSoftware, Inc. (NeXT). NeXT had developed, marketed, and supported software\nenabling customers to implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide\nWeb, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. Of the total purchase\nprice of $427 million, $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process\nresearch and development and $52 million was allocated to goodwill and other\nintangible assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged\nto operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are\nbeing amortized on a straight-line basis over two to three years.\n\nTERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT\n\nIn August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of Power Computing\nCorporation (PCC), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS operating system,\nincluding PCC's customer database and its license to distribute the Mac OS. The\nagreement with PCC also included a release of claims between the parties. On\nJanuary 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets from\nPCC. The total purchase price was approximately $110 million, of which\n$75 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 1997 as \"termination of\nlicense agreement\" and $35 million was recorded as goodwill in the second\nquarter of 1998. The goodwill is being amortized over three years.\n\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n\nInterest and other income and expense (net) increased $59 million or 211% to\n$87 million during 1999 as compared to 1998. This increase is attributable to\ntwo primary factors. First, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments increased $926 million or 40% during 1999 resulting in an increase\nin interest income during 1999 of $44 million. Second, interest expense declined\n$15 million during 1999, primarily as a result of the conversion of\napproximately $661 million of the Company's convertible subordinated notes to\ncommon stock during the third quarter of 1999. During 1998, the Company\nexperienced a $27 million increase in interest income net of interest expense,\nthe result of higher cash and investment balances and lower average short-term\nborrowings, offset by decreased foreign exchange gains and increased other\nexpense.\n\n                                       15\n##PAGE\nGAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENT\n\nAs of September 26, 1997, the Company owned 42.3% of the outstanding stock of\nARM Holdings plc (ARM), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved\nin the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The\nCompany had accounted for this investment using the equity method through\nSeptember 25, 1998. On April 17, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering\nof its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The\nCompany sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes\nof approximately $24 million, which was recognized as other income. Foreign tax\nrecognized on this gain was approximately $7 million.\n\nAt the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common\nstock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method\nrequires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the\ninvestor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting\nfrom the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment reflecting its\nshare of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from such a\nsale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the Company also\nrecognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of approximately\n$16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased\nnet book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As of\nSeptember 25, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM\ncarried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately\n$22 million. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 11.6 million shares (split\nadjusted) of ARM stock. As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership\ninterest in ARM fell to 19.7%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of\nfiscal 1999, the Company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in ARM\nusing the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as\navailable-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income.\n\nDuring fiscal 1999, the Company sold approximately 32.6 million shares (split\nadjusted) of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded\na gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income\ntax of approximately $25 million. As of September 25, 1999, the Company's\nremaining 16 million shares of ARM stock are valued at $226 million. The fair\nvalue of the Company's investment in ARM is reflected in other assets as of\nSeptember 25, 1999, with an offsetting amount net of $84 million of related\ndeferred income taxes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\nPROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nAs of September 25, 1999, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from\ndeductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $613 million\nbefore being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on\nthe Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable\nbased on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of\nSeptember 25, 1999, a valuation allowance of $60 million was recorded against\nthe deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized.\nThe valuation allowance relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired\nfrom NeXT and to tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will\ncontinue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by\nassessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's\neffective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 11% compared to the higher statutory rate\ndue primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established\nvaluation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S.\ntaxes were provided.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax deficiencies\nfor the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments\nthereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions\nwith the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now\nbeen resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the\nyears 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been\nresolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the\nCompany. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations.\n\n                                       16\n##PAGE\nThe Company anticipates its effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 will be\napproximately 25%. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Company's\nactual results could differ because of several factors, including those set\nforth below in the subsection entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results\nand Financial Condition.\" Additionally, the actual future tax rate will be\nsignificantly impacted by the amount of and jurisdiction in which the Company's\nforeign profits are earned.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics for\neach of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):\n\n\n\n                                                                1999       1998       1997\n                                                              --------   --------   --------\n                                                                           \nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments..........   $3,226     $2,300     $1,459\nAccounts receivable, net....................................   $  681     $  955     $1,035\nInventory...................................................   $   20     $   78     $  437\nWorking capital.............................................   $2,736     $2,178     $1,606\nDays sales in accounts receivable(a)........................       46         56         58\nDays of supply in inventory(b)..............................        2          6         31\nOperating cash flow.........................................   $  798     $  775     $  154\n\n\n- ------------------------\n\n(a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales\n    for each period.\n\n(b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each\n    period.\n\nAs of September 25, 1999, the Company had $3.226 billion in cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $926 million or 40% over\nthe same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, the Company's\nprimary source of cash was $798 million in cash flows from operating activities.\nCash generated by operations was primarily from net income, declines in accounts\nreceivables and inventory resulting from improved asset management, and an\nincrease in accounts payable. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as\nof September 25, 1999 and 1998, include $4 million and $56 million,\nrespectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit.\n\nIn addition to the net purchase of short-term investments of $1.081 billion, net\ncash used by investing activities included $112 million for the purchase of\ninvestments in Samsung and Akamai discussed below and $47 million for the\npurchase of fixed assets. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds\nfrom the sale of ARM stock of $245 million and proceeds from the sale of\nequipment of $23 million. The Company expects the level of capital expenditures\nin 2000 will increase moderately from 1999.\n\nIn July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company\nto repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does\nnot obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire\nshares over any specified period of time. As of September 25, 1999, the Company\nhad repurchased a total of 1.25 million shares of its common stock at a cost of\n$75 million.\n\nOn November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit\nagreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR\nplus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the\nunused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this\ncredit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the\nCompany with an additional source of liquidity and to provide additional support\nto the Company's capital position in the event of short-term liquidity\ndisturbances in worldwide financial markets associated with the Year 2000\ncrossover.\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next\ntwelve months, including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan.\nHowever, given the Company's current non-investment grade debt ratings, if the\nCompany should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such\nborrowings could be\n\n                                       17\n##PAGE\nobtained at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at\nfavorable rates could materially adversely affect the Company's results of\noperations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nOTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS\n\nAs discussed above, the Company has categorized its shares in ARM as\navailable-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with\nunrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income. As of September 25, 1999, the Company held\n16 million shares of ARM stock valued at $226 million. During the first quarter\nof fiscal 2000 through December 17, 1999, the Company sold an additional\n5.1 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $136 million\nand gains before taxes of approximately $134 million. As of December 17, 1999,\nthe Company holds 10.9 million shares of ARM stock valued at approximately\n$690 million.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung\nElectronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's\nTFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment, in the form of\nthree year unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of\nSamsung common stock beginning in June 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon\nrate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their\nmaturity.\n\nIn June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n(Akamai), a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the\nform of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of\nAkamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of\nAkamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted from\nselling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of the\nclosing of a public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the first quarter\nof fiscal 2000, the Company has categorized its shares in Akamai as\navailable-for-sale requiring they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains\nand losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. As of December 17, 1999, the fair value of the Company's\ninvestment in Akamai was approximately $1.2 billion. Because Akamai is a newly\npublic company and its stock price has experienced significant volatility, the\nfair value of the Company's investment in Akamai may fluctuate significantly in\nthe future.\n\nYEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE\n\nTHE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW RELATED TO YEAR 2000 (Y2K) COMPLIANCE CONTAINS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE\nCOMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND\nELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K REGARDING Y2K COMPLIANCE.\n\nYEAR 2000\n\nThe Year 2000 (Y2K) issue is the result of certain computer hardware, operating\nsystem software and software application programs having been developed using\ntwo digits rather than four to define a year. For example, the clock circuit in\nthe hardware may be incapable of holding a date beyond the year 1999; some\noperating systems may recognize a date using \"00\" as the year 1900 rather than\n2000 and certain applications may have limited date processing capabilities.\nThese problems could result in the failure of major systems or miscalculations,\nwhich could have a material impact on companies through business interruption or\nshutdown, financial loss, damage to reputation, and legal liability to third\nparties.\n\nY2K PLAN\n\nThe Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) began\naddressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation strategy, which\naddressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement of the Company's\nvarious disparate legacy information technology (IT) Systems. In 1998, the\nCompany established a Year 2000 Executive Steering Committee (Steering\nCommittee) comprised of senior executives of the Company and the Company's Year\n2000 Project Management Office (PMO). The PMO reports to the Executive Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer, the Steering Committee, and the Audit and\nFinance Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n                                       18\n##PAGE\nThe PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic plan (Y2K\nPlan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's operations and\nbusiness processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four principal areas\nthat may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded Products; Third Party\nRelationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT Systems. With respect to the IT\nSystems and Non-IT Business Systems, the Y2K Plan consists of four separate but\noverlapping phases: Phase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment; Phase\nII--Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III--Remediation; and Phase\nIV--Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company has an ongoing Y2K Awareness\nProgram designed to keep employees informed about Y2K issues. The discussion\nbelow reflects management's estimate of the current status of the four principal\nareas of the Company's Y2K Plan. Regardless of the current status, all areas of\nthe Y2K Plan remain under review and subject to modification as deemed necessary\nthroughout the remainder of calendar 1999 through the date rollover and into\nJanuary 2000.\n\nAPPLE BRANDED PRODUCTS\n\nThe Company designs and manufactures personal computers, related peripherals,\noperating system software and application software, including Macintosh personal\ncomputers and the Mac OS, which are marketed under the \"Apple\" brand\n(collectively \"Apple Branded Products\"). The Company tested certain Apple\nBranded Products to determine Y2K compliance, although such testing did not\ninclude third party products bundled with Apple Branded Products and certain\nApple Branded Products no longer distributed and/or supported by the Company.\nFor purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant means a product will not produce\nerrors processing date data in connection with the year change from\nDecember 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used with accurate date data in\naccordance with its documentation, provided all other products (including other\nsoftware, firmware and hardware) used with it properly exchange date data with\nit. A Y2K compliant product will recognize the Year 2000 as a leap year.\nInformation about testing and Y2K compliance of Apple Branded Products is\navailable on the Apple corporate web site under the heading \"Year 2000 Readiness\nDisclosure\", at www.apple.com/about/year/. Such information, which is updated on\nan ongoing basis, is not to be considered part of this annual report. Because\nthe Company does not control the design of non-Apple Branded Products or third\nparty products that are bundled with Apple Branded Products, it cannot assure\nsuch products are Y2K compliant.\n\nSome Apple Branded Products installed at customer sites may require upgrades or\nother remediation. While the Company believes its customers are responsible for\nthe Y2K readiness of their IT and business environments, the Company has taken\nsteps to assist customers in achieving their readiness goals. Apple is issuing\nsoftware updates (at no additional charge) for most, but not all, known issues\nin certain Apple Branded Products.\n\nTHIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS\n\nThe Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party corporate\nservice vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations partners,\ndistributors and others. The Company is working with key external parties to\nidentify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K. The failure\nof external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely manner could\nresult in a material financial risk to the Company. As part of its Y2K Plan and\nto establish the state of readiness of certain third parties, the Company is\nactively communicating on an ongoing basis with certain third parties whose lack\nof Y2K compliance would present a high degree of risk to the Company. Based on\ninformation obtained from various sources, the Company believes it is reasonably\npossible there will be interruptions around the world in critical services such\nas air traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance,\ntelecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could\nresult in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods. The Company also\nbelieves it is reasonably possible that worldwide financial markets could\nexhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of\ncalendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. Such events could result in\nmaterial adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial\nposition. See further discussion regarding this issue below under the heading\n\"Contingency Plans.\" The Company has substantially completed its review of\ncertain third parties as of the\n\n                                       19\n##PAGE\nend of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Although numerous third parties have\nadvised the Company they are addressing their Y2K issues, the readiness of third\nparties overall varies widely. Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent\non the timely Y2K compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances the\nCompany's efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues. The Company continues to\ncommunicate with and monitor the compliance efforts of key third parties. The\nCompany will continue these efforts with key third parties through the date\nrollover and into January 2000.\n\nIT SYSTEMS AND NON-IT BUSINESS SYSTEMS\n\nPhase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment:\n\nThis Phase requires an inventory and assessment of the Non-IT Business Systems\nused by the Company, including systems with embedded technology, building access\nsystems, and health and safety systems. This Phase also includes inventory and\nassessment of IT Systems used by the Company, including large IS&T systems,\ndesktop hardware and software, and network hardware and software. Each system is\nevaluated and the business risk is quantified as being High, Medium or Low Risk\nto the Company's business. Systems that are High Risk are those, which if\nuncorrected, would cause an interruption of or complete failure to conduct the\nCompany's business. Medium Risks are those that would negatively impact the\nbusiness but complete cessation could be avoided with some inconvenience. Low\nRisks are those where the risk to business interruption or cessation are remote.\nThe Company intends that High and Medium Risk items will be remediated or\nreplaced, and Low Risk items will likely not be addressed prior to the Year\n2000. The status of the Company's remediation efforts is discussed below. The\nCompany had substantially completed the Inventory and Risk Assessment Phase for\nboth IT Systems and Non-IT Systems by the end of the third quarter of fiscal\n1999. However, the Company has and will continue to review information developed\nas the result of its Y2K Plan, which could result in additional items being\nadded to its Y2K inventory.\n\nPhase II--Remediation Cost Estimation:\n\nThis Phase involves the analysis of each High and Medium Risk to determine how\nsuch risks may be remediated and the cost of such remediation. The Company has\nsubstantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems.\n\nPhase III--Remediation:\n\nThis Phase includes the replacement or correction of the High and Medium Risk\nNon-IT Business Systems and IT Systems. The Company substantially completed this\nPhase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems during the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 1999.\n\nPhase IV--Remediation Testing:\n\nThis Phase includes the future date testing of the remediation efforts made in\nPhase III to confirm that the changes made bring the affected systems into\ncompliance, no new problems have arisen as a result of the remediation, and new\nsystems that replaced noncompliant systems are Y2K compliant. The Company\nsubstantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems\nduring the first quarter of fiscal 2000.\n\nCOSTS TO ADDRESS Y2K\n\nThe costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the utilization\nof existing internal resources and incremental external spending. The Company's\ncurrent estimate of total incremental external spending over the life of its Y2K\nplan to address those risks identified as High or Medium is approximately\n$10 million of which approximately $9 million had been spent as of\nSeptember 25, 1999. As the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future\nincremental spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not\ninclude the costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its\nsignificant third party vendors fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is\nnot separately identifying\n\n                                       20\n##PAGE\nand including in these estimates the Y2K costs incurred that are the result of\nutilization of the Company's existing internal resources.\n\nCONTINGENCY PLANS\n\nUnder the guidance and management of the PMO, the Company is in the final stages\nof developing, implementing, and testing Y2K contingency plans for critical\nbusiness operations. The Company's contingency plans, which are based in part on\nthe assessment of the magnitude and probability of potential risks, primarily\nfocus on proactive steps to prevent Y2K failures from occurring, or if they\nshould occur, to detect them quickly, minimize their impact and expedite their\nremediation. The Y2K contingency plans will supplement existing disaster\nrecovery and business continuity plans.\n\nAs part of its contingency plans, the Company has developed a global Incident\nManagement Team (IMT) to identify, escalate, and mitigate the potential impact\nof various Y2K failures. The IMT is comprised of personnel from the PMO as well\nas key areas of the Company's operations. The IMT will begin to monitor the date\nrollover commencing with Sydney, Australia and will \"follow the sun\" through the\ntime change in the Pacific Standard Time zone. The Company's contingency\nplanning efforts were approximately 85% complete at the end of the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 1999 and are expected to be substantially completed during the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2000.\n\nThe Company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions in\nair traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance,\ntelecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could\nresult in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods and other business\ninterruptions. The Company has developed and implemented contingency plans to\nmitigate the effects of a short-term interruption in such services. However, if\nthe interruption in these services last for an extended period of time, or if\nalternative Y2K compliant services are not readily available at reasonable cost,\nthere could be material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations\nand financial position.\n\nThe Company also believes it is reasonably possible worldwide financial markets\ncould exhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the\nend of calendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. The Company has\ndeveloped and implemented contingency plans to mitigate some of the potential\nshort-term effects of such disturbances. However, if these disturbances in the\nfinancial markets last for an extended period of time, or if alternative\nmitigating actions are not readily available at reasonable cost, there could be\nmaterial adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial\nposition.\n\nRISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH Y2K ISSUES\n\nThe Company has substantially completed its initial assessment of reasonably\nlikely worst case scenarios of Non-IT Business Systems and/or IT Systems\nfailures and related consequences. Based on current information, the Company\nbelieves the most likely worst case scenario is it will experience minor\nmalfunctions and failures of its IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems at the\nbeginning of the Year 2000 not previously detected during the Company's\ninventory and risk assessment and remediation activities. The Company currently\nbelieves these malfunctions and failures will not have a material impact on its\nresults of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance\nthe Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be properly and timely\ncompleted, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany, its business, its results of operations, and its financial condition.\n\nIn particular, the Company believes a lack of Y2K readiness by its significant\nthird party vendors could cause material interruptions in the Company's\noperations. The identification of additional issues with respect to the Y2K\ncompliance of key third parties could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause\nresults to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the\nCompany to successfully identify systems and vendors that have a Y2K issue, the\nnature and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected systems,\nthe adequacy of such remediation efforts, the production-related contingency\nplans of competitors with the Company's\n\n                                       21\n##PAGE\nthird party suppliers, and the costs and availability of labor and resources to\nsuccessfully address the Y2K issues and/or to execute on any required\ncontingency plans.\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by\naggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\nintroduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement\nin product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of\nconsumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's results of\noperations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to\nbe, adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures\non gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid\ntechnological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and\nfeatures based on existing or emerging industry standards. Several competitors\nof the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target\ncertain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education and\npublishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced\nor announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design\nand technical features of the Company's products. Many of the Company's\ncompetitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological\nresources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases\nthan those of the Company. Additionally, the Company's future operating results\nand financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers\nand general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of\nproduct features over another.\n\nThe Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS\nhas a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated\nby makers of computers utilizing Microsoft Windows operating systems. The\nCompany believes the innovative industrial design of its products, the unique\nset of features its products currently provide, the perceived advantages of the\nMac OS over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base\nto incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind sales\nof the Company's personal computer hardware in recent years. The Company is\ncurrently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive\npressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent\ninnovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to\ndevelop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived\ndesign and functional advantages over competing platforms.\n\nPRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS\n\nDue to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is\ncharacterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological\nadvances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies\nand enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new\nproduct introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market\nacceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product\ntransitions, the availability of application software for new products, the\neffective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other\ndefects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot\ndetermine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or\nresults of operations.\n\nThe Company plans to continue to introduce upgrades to the current Mac OS, Mac\nOS 9, and later introduce a new operating system, Mac OS X Client, which is\nexpected to offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software\ntechnologies. It is uncertain whether Mac OS X will gain developer support and\nmarket acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of\na substantially backward-compatible Mac OS X or of planned enhancements to the\ncurrent Mac OS, or to gain\n\n                                       22\n##PAGE\ndeveloper support and market acceptance for those operating systems, may have an\nadverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\n\nINVENTORY AND SUPPLY\n\nThe Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that\nhave become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand and accrues for any\ncancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although\nthe Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given\nthe rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer\nindustry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional\ninventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again\nhave, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of\noperations.\n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in\nadvance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will\nforecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of\nparticular products. The Company's operating results and financial condition\nhave been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by\nthe Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term\nshifts in customer demand patterns.\n\nMany of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by\nthird-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its\ntransportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may\nlower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such\ndiminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products\nmanufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market\nconditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain\nprovisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least\ninitially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.\nAccordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company\nmay remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty\nliability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or\notherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n\nAlthough certain components essential to the Company's business are generally\navailable from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors\nand application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are currently obtained\nby the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components\n(including without limitation DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while\ncurrently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject\nto industry wide availability and pricing pressures. If the supply of a key\ncomponent were to be delayed or constrained, the Company's business and\nfinancial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time\nrequired to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or, if\npossible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source.\nThe Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete\nfor other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced\nincreased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or\nincreased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone\nand automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some components that are\nnot common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain\nmicroprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be\naffected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of\ncomponents other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such\nproduct supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the\nCompany's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n\nThe Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also\ndependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of\nthe PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to\nprovide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with\n\n                                       23\n##PAGE\nprice/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the\nCompany's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers\nof microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating\nsystems.\n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product\nmay be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Raw\nMaterials,\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements at Note 8 under the subheading \"Concentrations\nin the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product,\" which information\nis hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national\nand regional retailers and cataloguers, and directly to education institutions\nfor resale (collectively referred to as \"resellers\"). In addition, the Company\nalso sells many of its products in most of its major markets directly to end\nusers through its on-line store. Many of the Company's significant resellers\noperate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers also distribute products\nfrom competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial results could\nbe adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if\nresellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's\nproducts, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products causes\nresellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.\n\nFurther information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution\nmay be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Markets and\nDistribution,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nGLOBAL MARKET RISKS\n\nA large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international\noperations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition\ncould be significantly affected by risks associated with international\nactivities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax\nlaws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and\ngoods and services are purchased.\n\nCountries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have recently experienced\nweaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses have\nadversely affected and may continue to adversely affect consumer demand for the\nCompany's products, the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency\ndenominated sales, the availability and cost of product components to the\nCompany, and consequently the Company's results of operations.\n\nFurther information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in\nPart II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Foreign Currency Risk\"\nand may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated\nby reference.\n\nSUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS\n\nDecisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed\nto Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party\nsoftware for particular applications. The Company believes the availability of\nthird-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in\npart on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits\nof developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's\nproducts versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based\non factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the\nanticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing\nsuch software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior\nyears and declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the Company's\ndecision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused\n\n                                       24\n##PAGE\nsoftware developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer\nmarket, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or\nupgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote\ntheir resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows\nmarket. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce Mac OS X could cause\nsoftware developers to stop developing software for the current Mac OS. In\naddition, there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop\nsoftware for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all.\n\nIn August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into patent cross licensing\nand technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years from\nAugust 1997, as subject to certain limitations related to the number of\nMacintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft will make future versions of\nits Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. The Company\nwill bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases\nand make that product the default Internet browser for such releases. While the\nCompany believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to\nbe beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base\nfor the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not\ncover many of the areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including\nthe Windows platform. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application\nsoftware for the Mac OS not covered by the relationship or following expiration\nof the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests\nas the vendor of the Windows operating system. In addition, the Microsoft\nrelationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's\nrelationship with other partners. There can be no assurance the benefits to the\nCompany of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages.\n\nEURO CONVERSION\n\nOn January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union\nadopted the Euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion\nrates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro is now\ntraded on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. A three\nyear transition period began during which transactions can be made in the old\ncurrencies.\n\nThe Company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities, review the\nability of financial institution vendors to support Euro transactions, and\nexamine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the\nEuro conversion. The cost of this effort is not expected to have a material\nadverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance, however, all issues related to the Euro conversion\nhave been identified and that any additional issues would not have a material\neffect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The\nconversion to the Euro may have competitive implications on the Company's\npricing and marketing strategies, the impact of which are not known at this\ntime. Additionally, the Company is at risk to the extent its principal European\nsuppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the\nEuro conversion.\n\nOTHER FACTORS\n\nThe potential risks associated with the Company's Y2K Plan are discussed above\nunder the heading \"Year 2000 Compliance.\"\n\nThe majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate\nheadquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major\nvendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results\nand financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a\nmajor earthquake.\n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject\nthe Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances,\nthe requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to\nthe Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for\nenvironmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the\nCompany does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on\nthe nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be\ngiven such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the\nenvironment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\n                                       25\n##PAGE\nBecause of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the\nCompany's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance\nshould not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\ninvestors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in\nfuture periods. In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic\nindustry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock\nprice.\n"}, "2000": {"item1": "ITEM 1.

It provides performance and stability through full\npre-emptive multi-tasking, protected memory, advanced virtual memory, QuickTime\nStreaming Server software, and NetBoot; a Mac OS X server feature allowing a\nnetwork of Macs to be booted and configured from a single server.\n\nAPPLICATION SOFTWARE\n\nThe Company has two primary digital video authoring/editing software titles.\nFinal Cut Pro-Registered Trademark- 1.2.5 is video authoring software designed\nto meet the demanding needs of the professional video editing environment that\ncombines professional-quality video editing, compositing, and special effects in\none package. Apple introduced iMovie-TM- 2, an update to its easy-to-use\nconsumer digital video editing software, in July 2000. iMovie 2 makes it easy to\ncreate home and classroom movies and features an enhanced user interface,\nimproved audio editing capabilities, enhanced controls for titling and\ntransitions, and added special effects. iMovie 2 is preinstalled on all\nFireWire-Registered Trademark- enabled Macintoshes.\n\nAppleWorks-Registered Trademark- 6 is an integrated productivity application\nthat incorporates word processing, spreadsheet, database, drawing, painting, and\npresentation features in a single software package. Intended to be an\neasy-to-use product for the Company's consumer and education customers,\nAppleWorks 6 makes it simple to create professional looking documents in the\nclassroom and at home.\n\nFileMaker-Registered Trademark- Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the\nCompany, develops, publishes, and distributes desktop based database management\napplication software for Mac OS and Windows-based systems. Filemaker's FileMaker\nPro-TM- database software and related products offers strong relational\ndatabases and advanced desktop-to-web publishing capabilities.\n\nINTERNET SOFTWARE, INTEGRATION, AND SERVICES\n\nApple's Internet strategy is focused on delivering seamless integration with and\naccess to the Internet throughout the Company's product lines. In addition to\nSherlock 2, an easy Internet Setup Assistant is an integral part of Mac OS 9,\nthe current version of the Macintosh operating system.\n\nQuickTime-TM- 4 Player, the Company's current version of its multimedia software\nfor Macintosh and Windows platforms, features streaming of live and stored video\nand audio over the Internet. Since its release in June 1999, over 100 million\ncopies of QuickTime 4 software have been distributed free to Macintosh and\nWindows users worldwide. QuickTime 4 Pro is a suite of software that allows\nQuickTime files to be created and edited and allows a user to add special\neffects to QuickTime movies. QuickTime Streaming Server software is the\nunderlying server technology that powers QuickTime 4's ability to stream live\nand stored video and audio over the Internet. QuickTime Streaming Server can be\ndownloaded for free as Open Source software and is included in Mac OS X Server.\n\nIn July 1999, Apple introduced QuickTime TV (QTV), a high quality network for\nInternet-based video and audio streaming. QTV integrates four key elements:\nApple's QuickTime 4 Player software, Apple's open-source QuickTime Streaming\nServer software, video and audio content from leading providers, and the\nstreamed content delivery service offered by Apple and Akamai\nTechnologies, Inc. QTV currently has over 50 channels encompassing many leading\nnews, entertainment, music, radio, and educational content providers.\n\nWebObjects-Registered Trademark-, the Company's web application server software,\noffers a complete solution for rapid development and deployment of web\napplications. WebObjects features sophisticated graphical development tools,\ncomprehensive prebuilt and reusable components, integration with numerous data\nsources, and robust deployment tools.\n\n                                       3\n##PAGE\nApple currently offers four free Internet services collectively called iTools.\nKidSafe is a service designed to control children's use of the Internet by\nmaking only approved websites available to them. Mac.Com is an email service run\nby Apple. iDisk offers users 20 megabytes of private or public storage on\nApple's Internet servers. HomePage allows users to create their own personal\nwebsite hosted by Apple with personalized content including data, pictures, and\nmovies. In addition to the four iTools, Apple also offers on its corporate\nwebsite iReview, an Internet site review guide, and iCards, an electronic\ngreeting card service.\n\nIn January 2000, the Company and EarthLink Network Inc. (EarthLink), an Internet\nservice provider (ISP), entered into a multi-year agreement to deliver ISP\nservice to Macintosh users in the United States. Under the terms of the\nagreement, the Company profits from each new Mac customer that subscribes to\nEarthLink's ISP service, for a specified period of time, and EarthLink is the\ndefault ISP in Apple's Internet Setup Software included with all Macintosh\ncomputers sold in the United States.\n\nTHIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS\n\nThousands of third-party software titles and solutions are available for the\nMacintosh platform. The Company sells a variety of these third-party software\nproducts directly to end users through its on-line store. Additional information\nregarding the Company's relationship with and dependence upon third-party\nsoftware developers, including Microsoft Corporation, may be found in Part II,\nItem 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Support from Third-Party Software\nDevelopers\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results\nand Financial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nMARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and\nbusiness markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh computers for a\nvariety of reasons, including the reduced amount of training resulting from the\nMacintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, advanced graphics capabilities,\nindustrial design features of the Company's hardware products, ability of\nMacintosh computers to network and communicate with other computer systems and\nenvironments, and availability of application software. Apple personal computers\nwere first introduced to education customers in the late 1970s. In the United\nStates, the Company is one of the major suppliers of personal computers for both\nelementary and secondary school customers, as well as for college and university\ncustomers. The Company is also a supplier to institutions of higher education\noutside of the United States.\n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national\nand regional retailers and cataloguers. During 2000, a single distributor,\nIngram Micro Inc., accounted for approximately 11.5% of net sales. No other\ncustomer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during 2000, and no individual\ncustomer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 1999 or 1998. The Company\nalso sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most\nof its major markets to consumers, certain education customers, and certain\nresellers either directly or through one of its on-line stores around the world.\nDuring 2000, net sales attributable to the Company's on-line stores totaled\napproximately $1.7 billion.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe market for the design, manufacture, and sale of personal computers and\nrelated software and peripheral products is highly competitive. It continues to\nbe characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software\ndevelopment, which have substantially increased the capabilities and\napplications of these products, and has resulted in the frequent introduction of\nnew products and significant price, feature, and performance competition.\nFurther, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance\non the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller,\nsimpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for\nmarket share with the\n\n                                       4\n##PAGE\nCompany's existing products. The principal competitive factors in this market\nare relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design\ninnovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and\ndistribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware\nperipherals, and corporate reputation. The Company is currently taking and will\ncontinue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on\nits personal computer sales as a result of innovations in the Windows platform.\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially\ndependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh\nplatform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over\ncompeting platforms.\n\nFurther information relating to the competitive conditions of the personal\ncomputing industry and the Company's competitive position in that market place\nmay be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Competition,\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future\nResults and Financial Condition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by\nreference.\n\nRAW MATERIALS\n\nAlthough certain components essential to the Company's business are generally\navailable from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors\nand application-specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are currently obtained\nby the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while\ncurrently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject\nto industry wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company\nuses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer\nindustry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize\ncustom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated\nwhether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. If\nthe supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be\ndelayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments\nof completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related\nproducts in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely\naffected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be\nadversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient\nquantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient\nquantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these\ncomponents may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the\nproduction of common components instead of components customized to meet the\nCompany's requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks\nby working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction\nplans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal\nand external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry\npractice, components are normally acquired through purchase orders typically\ncovering the Company's forecasted requirements for periods from 30 to 130 days.\nHowever, the Company continues to evaluate the need for a supply contract in\neach situation.\n\nThe Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing\nvendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the\nCompany's business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include\nAlpha-Top Corporation, Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc.,\nDarfon Electronics Corporation, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM\nCorporation, LG Electronics, Lucent Technologies Inc., Matsushita, Mitsubishi\nElectric Corporation, Motorola, Inc., NatSteel Electronics PTE Ltd., Philips\nSemiconductors, Samsung Electronics, and Quanta Computer, Inc.\n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product\nmay be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading\n\"Inventory and Supply\" included under the heading \"Factors That May Affect\nFuture Results and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9 under the\nsubheading \"Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and\nProduct,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n                                       5\n##PAGE\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nBecause the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological\nadvances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent\nupon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products\nand technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products\nand technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and\nperipherals, system software, applications software, networking and\ncommunications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company's research\nand development expenditures, before any charges for in-process research and\ndevelopment, totaled $380 million, $314 million, and $303 million in 2000, 1999,\nand 1998, respectively.\n\nPATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES\n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain\naspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition,\nthe Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the\nUnited States and a number of foreign countries for\n\"Apple-Registered Trademark-\", the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple color logo,\n\"Macintosh-Registered Trademark-,\" and numerous other product trademarks. In\n1986, the Company acquired ownership of the trademark \"Macintosh\" for use in\nconnection with computer products. Although the Company believes the ownership\nof such patents, copyrights, and trademarks is an important factor in its\nbusiness and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the\nCompany relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and\nmarketing abilities of its personnel.\n\nMany of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property\nobtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or\nrenew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods,\nthe Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such\nlicenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because\nof technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent\ncoverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain\ncomponents of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly\ninfringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been\nnotified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual\nproperty rights of others. However, no litigation has arisen out of any of these\nclaims that has had, or is expected to have, an adverse impact on the Company's\noperating results and financial condition. The Company believes that any\nnecessary patent or other rights could be obtained on commercially reasonable\nterms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be\navailable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the Company would prevail in\nany such challenge. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or\nlitigation arising out of such claims, could adversely affect the Company's\nresults of operations and financial condition.\n\nFOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\n\nThe United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace.\nApproximately 52% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2000 came from operations\ninside the United States. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is\nconducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California,\nCork, Ireland, and Singapore and by external vendors in Taiwan, Korea, Mexico,\nthe People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Margins on sales of\nApple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include\ncomponents obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations,\nincluding tariffs and antidumping penalties.\n\nInformation regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in\nPart II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements at Note 10, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data,\" which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference. Additional information\nregarding the risks associated with international operations is set forth in\nPart II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Global Market Risks,\"\nincluded under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial\nCondition,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\n                                       6\n##PAGE\nSEASONAL BUSINESS\n\nAlthough the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it\nhas historically experienced increased sales in its first and fourth fiscal\nquarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand\nrelated to the holiday season and the school year. However, past performance\nshould not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales\nor financial performance.\n\nWARRANTY\n\nThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products.\nThe warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end\nuser. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple software and for Apple\nservice parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may\npurchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the\nCompany's major markets.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.\nIn particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers\nanticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog\nshould not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to\nachieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS\n\nCompliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the\nprotection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the\nCompany's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although the\nCompany does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on\nthe nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be\ngiven such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the\nenvironment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of September 30, 2000, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 8,568\nemployees and an additional 3,160 temporary employees and contractors.\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": "ITEM 7.

30% increase in net sales over 1999 which\nwas the result of a 32% rise in Macintosh unit sales. This increase in Macintosh\nunit sales is primarily attributable to increased sales of iMac, the company's\nmoderately priced desktop Macintosh system designed for the education and\nconsumer markets, and the introduction of iBook, the Company's consumer and\neducation oriented notebook computer introduced at the end of 1999. The Company\nsold approximately 2.2 million iMacs in 2000, an increase of approximately\n400,000 units or 22% over iMac unit sales in 1999. During 2000, the Company sold\napproximately 545,000 iBooks. iBook contributed $809 million to net sales during\n2000. The Company also experienced modest gains in combined unit sales of its\nprofessionally oriented Macintosh systems, PowerMacs and PowerBooks. Growth in\nnet sales and unit sales was strong in all of the Company's geographic operating\nsegments, particularly in Europe and Japan.\n\nPROFITABILITY\n\nThe Company experienced improved profitability in 2000. Operating income before\nspecial charges rose 61% to $620 million in 2000 from $386 million in 1999.\nImproved profitability was driven by the 30% increase in net sales, stable\noverall gross margins in 2000 as compared to 1999, and a relatively modest\nincrease in operating expenses before special charges of 18%.\n\nOPERATING TRENDS\n\nDespite overall increases during 2000 in net sales, unit sales, and\nprofitability, the Company's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000\nwas disappointing. Net sales during the fourth quarter fell short of the\nCompany's expectations by approximately $180 million causing operating margin\nbefore special charges to fall to 4% for the quarter as compared to the 9%\nexperienced during the first nine months of fiscal 2000. The fourth quarter\nrevenue shortfall was primarily the result of three factors. First, fourth\nquarter net sales\n\n                                       12\n##PAGE\nof the G4 Cube, a new Macintosh system announced and introduced by the Company\nduring the fourth quarter, did not meet the Company's expectations. In\ncombination with related displays, G4 Cube sales were approximately $90 million\nshort of expectations. Second, net sales in the Company's education market fell\nshort of expectations by approximately $60 million. Third, although total fourth\nquarter Power Mac unit sales were close to expectations, the Company experienced\nan unanticipated mix shift towards lower priced Power Mac configurations\nresulting in lower than anticipated net sales for the quarter of approximately\n$30 million. The Company ended 2000 with substantially more inventory in its\ndistribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through\nof the Company's products during the fourth quarter.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nThe Company currently anticipates a significant sequential decline in quarterly\nnet sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to approximately\n$1.0 billion. This decline is anticipated because of a continued deterioration\nin demand experienced by the Company during the first two months of fiscal 2001,\nrebate programs and price cuts instituted during the first quarter that will\ncost the Company approximately $135 million, and a plan to reduce substantially\nby the end of the first quarter the level of inventory in the Company's\ndistribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal 2000. In addition,\nthe Company expects to incur approximately $115 million of cancellation charges\nrelated to purchase orders for proprietary components due to the reduced sales\noutlook. As a result of these factors, the Company anticipates reporting a net\nloss, before the effect of any investment gains, in the range of $225 million to\n$250 million for the first quarter of 2001.\n\nFor all of 2001, the Company anticipates net sales will decline as compared to\n2000, falling in the range of $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion. The Company\ncurrently expects that it will be profitable, before the effect of any\ninvestment gains, during each of the last three quarters of 2001.\n\nThe foregoing statements concerning the Company's anticipated operating results\nduring the first quarter of 2001 and the Company's anticipated operating result\nfor all of 2001 are forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ.\nThe Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent\nupon general economic conditions, market conditions within the PC industry, and\nthe Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market\ntechnologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions\nwithin the highly competitive market for personal computers. Some of the\npotential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future\noperating results and financial condition are discussed throughout this Item 7,\nincluding the discussion under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future\nResults and Financial Condition.\"\n\n                                       13\n##PAGE\nNET SALES\n\nNet sales for geographic segments and Macintosh unit sales by geographic segment\nand by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in\nthousands):\n\n\n\n                                                         2000      CHANGE      1999      CHANGE      1998\n                                                       --------   --------   --------   --------   --------\n                                                                                    \nAmericas net sales...................................   $4,298       22 %     $3,527        2 %     $3,468\nEurope net sales.....................................    1,817       38 %      1,317        2 %      1,295\nJapan net sales......................................    1,345       57 %        858       17 %        731\nAsia Pacific net sales...............................      355       16 %        306        4 %        293\nOther segments net sales.............................      168       33 %        126      (18)%        154\n                                                        ------                ------                ------\n  Total net sales....................................   $7,983       30 %     $6,134        3 %     $5,941\n                                                        ======                ======                ======\n\nAmericas Macintosh unit sales........................    2,507       24 %      2,021       22 %      1,655\nEurope Macintosh unit sales..........................    1,110       53 %        724       23 %        588\nJapan Macintosh unit sales...........................      730       39 %        524       35 %        389\nAsia Pacific Macintosh unit sales....................      211       18 %        179       37 %        131\n                                                        ------                ------                ------\n  Total Macintosh unit sales.........................    4,558       32 %      3,448       25 %      2,763\n                                                        ======                ======                ======\n\nPower Macintosh unit sales...........................    1,329        3 %      1,296        2 %      1,266\nPowerBook unit sales.................................      383       11 %        344      (19)%        427\nG4 Cube unit sales...................................      107       --           --       --           --\niMac unit sales(a)...................................    2,194       22 %      1,802       68 %      1,070\niBook unit sales.....................................      545       --            6       --           --\n                                                        ------                ------                ------\n  Total Macintosh unit sales.........................    4,558       32 %      3,448       25 %      2,763\n                                                        ======                ======                ======\n\n\n------------------------\n\n(a) Unit sales figures for iMac in 1998 include sales of the Company's previous\n    consumer and education oriented Macintosh products.\n\nNet sales rose 30% to a total of $7.983 billion in 2000 as compared to 1999. The\nincrease in net sales resulted directly from a 32% increase in Macintosh unit\nsales. Driving unit sales growth was a 51% increase in combined unit sales of\nthe Company's consumer and education Macintosh systems, iMac and iBook, and a\nmodest increase of 11% in combined units sales of the Company's professionally\noriented Macintosh systems. Combined unit sales of iMac and iBook systems\naccounted for 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 and 60% in 2000. This\ntrend highlights the increasing importance to the Company of its consumer and\neducation markets. During 2000, the average revenue per Macintosh system, a\nfunction of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh\nCPU unit sales, of $1,715 was relatively unchanged from 1999. This was due to\nincreased unit sales of higher priced Power Mac, PowerBook, iBook, and G4 Cube\nsystems offset by increases in unit sales of lower priced iMac systems.\nAdditional comments regarding net sales for 2000 may be found above under the\nheading \"Fiscal 2000 Overview.\"\n\nNet sales increased $193 million or 3% to $6.134 billion in 1999 compared to\n1998. The primary source of this growth was an overall 25% increase in Macintosh\nunit sales, which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the Company's\ngeographic operating segments. Offsetting the rise in unit shipments during 1999\nwas a decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system which fell 17% to\n$1,739 from $2,095 in 1998. The decline during 1999 in the average revenue per\nMacintosh system was attributable to lower pricing for both iMac and Power Mac\nproducts, which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower\npricing. The decline was also attributable to the shift in the Company's unit\nmix toward lower-priced consumer products such that iMac units and comparable\nproducts comprised 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 versus 39% in 1998.\n\n                                       14\n##PAGE\nNet sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to\nthe third quarter by $222 million or 14%, and declined $220 million or 14%\ncompared to the same period in 1998. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales declined\n15% and 7% during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter of\n1999 and the same period in 1998, respectively. The primary causes for these\ndeclines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of\nPowerPC G4 processors from Motorola and production interruptions at vendors\nsupplying PowerBooks and iBooks experienced during the last week of the fourth\nquarter of 1999 as a result of the earthquake in Taiwan on September 20, 1999.\nThe shortage of G4 processors reduced Power Macintosh net sales by approximately\n$200 million during the fourth quarter of 1999.\n\nSEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's\ngeographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The\nAmericas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment\nincludes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan\nsegment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia\nand Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar\nhardware and software products and similar services. Further information\nregarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on\nthis Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 10,\n\"Segment Information and Geographic Data,\" which information is hereby\nincorporated by reference.\n\nAMERICAS\n\nNet sales and unit sales in the Americas segment increased 22% and 24%,\nrespectively, during 2000 as compared to 1999. During 2000, the Americas segment\nrepresented approximately 54% and 55% of the Company's total net sales and total\nMacintosh unit sales, respectively. The growth of the Americas' net sales in\n2000 was indicative of strong growth in unit sales of iMac and iBook and\nrelatively flat unit sales of professionally oriented Macintosh systems.\n\nNet sales in the Americas segment increased 2% to $3.527 billion during 1999 as\ncompared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 22%. This followed a 5%\ndecline in net sales in the Americas between 1998 and 1997. During 1999, the\nAmericas segment represented approximately 57% and 59% of the Company's total\nnet sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The results experienced\nby this segment in 1999 reflect the overall trends experienced by the Company\nduring 1999 of increasing Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average\nrevenue per Macintosh system.\n\nEUROPE\n\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased 38% during 2000 driven by a 53%\nincrease in Macintosh unit sales. Growth in unit sales resulted from a 96%\nincrease in combined unit sales of iMac and iBook, and an increase of 19% in\ncombined units sales of the Company's professionally oriented Macintosh systems.\n\nNet sales in the Europe segment increased 2% to $1.317 billion during 1999 as\ncompared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 23%. This followed a 16%\ndecline in net sales in the Europe segment between 1998 and 1997. Like the\nAmericas segment, Europe's results in 1999 as compared to 1998 were indicative\nof strong growth in Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average\nrevenue per Macintosh system.\n\nJAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC\n\nNet sales in the Japan segment increased 57% to $1.345 billion in 2000 as\ncompared to 1999, while Japan's Macintosh unit sales increased 39%. The fact\nthat Japan's net sales rose at a higher rate than its unit sales reflects\nseveral factors. First, iMac unit sales in Japan were relatively flat\nyear-over-year. Second, unit sales of iBook, which generally carry a higher\nprice than iMac units and which were first sold in Japan during 2000, accounted\nfor approximately 17% of Japan's total Macintosh unit sales during 2000. Third,\nJapan saw a 43% increase in combined unit sales of the Company's professionally\noriented Macintosh systems.\n\n                                       15\n##PAGE\nThe majority of the increase in both net sales and unit sales in the Asia\nPacific segment can be attributed to sales of the G4 Cube and iBook, both of\nwhich were introduced in the region during 2000.\n\nMacintosh unit sales and net sales in Asia, particularly in Japan, recovered\nduring 1999 from the declines experienced in 1998. Net sales in the Japan\nsegment increased 17% or $127 million to a total of $858 million in 1999 as\ncompared to 1998. Macintosh unit sales in Japan increased 35% during 1999\ncompared to 1998 while Macintosh unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment\nincreased 37%. The increases in net sales and Macintosh unit sales in both Japan\nand Asia Pacific are the result of strong iMac sales experienced by these\noperating segments, strong growth in Japanese consumer sales, and the general\neconomic recovery experienced in the region.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any\nparticular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects.\nIn particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately\nfollowing new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers\nanticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers\nbelieve they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog\nshould not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to\nachieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further\ninformation regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the\nsubheading \"Product Introductions and Transitions\" included under the heading\n\"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nGROSS MARGIN\n\nGross margin was relatively stable during 2000 as compared to 1999, declining to\n27.1% during 2000 from 27.6% during 1999. The half point decline is primarily\nthe result of a shift in mix of unit sales away from the Company's higher\npriced, higher margin professionally oriented Macintosh systems towards its\nlower priced, lower margin consumer and education oriented Macintosh systems.\nAlso contributing to the relative stability of its gross margin, the Company\nexperienced relatively stable component pricing during 2000 as compared to 1999.\n\nGross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1999 to 27.6% as\ncompared to 24.9% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to declines\nin the cost of various components of the Company's products, improvements in\nmanufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final\nassembly of certain of the Company's products, improved design of products\nleading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs, and relatively stable pricing\nof the Company's products over the last six months of 1999. During 1999, the\nCompany was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily\nin 1998 and 1997 that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient\ndistribution model for its products.\n\nThere can be no assurance current gross margins will be maintained, targeted\ngross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual\nproducts will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual\nproducts will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of\nfactors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased\ncompetition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and\navailability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential\nchanges to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer\nproducts with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response\nto these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take\npricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be\naffected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and\nwarranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The\nCompany's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes\nin foreign currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of\noperations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in\nexchange rates.\n\n                                       16\n##PAGE\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company recognizes focused investments in research and development are\ncritical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and\nare directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are\ncentral to the Company's core business strategy. Expenditures on research and\ndevelopment increased 21% or $66 million to $380 million in 2000 as compared to\n1999. This followed a $11 million or 4% increase in 1999 as compared to 1998.\nSpending on R&D has remained at approximately 5% of net sales during each of the\nlast three years. The overall increase in R&D spending over the last two years\nis directly related to increases in R&D headcount of approximately 13% over that\ntime to support expanded product development efforts.\n\nSELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 17% to\n$1,166 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 and decreased to 15% of net sales in\n2000 from 16% in 1999. This increase in total expenditures resulted from higher\nspending for promotional and marketing activities, increased sales expenses\nresulting from higher net sales, and a 21% increase in combined sales,\nmarketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end of 1999 to the\nend of 2000.\n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% to $996 million\nin 1999 as compared to 1998 and increased to 16% of net sales in 1999 from 15%\nin 1998. These increases are primarily the result of increased spending on\nmarketing and promotional activities throughout 1999 and a 12% increase in\ncombined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end\nof 1998 to the end of 1999.\n\nSPECIAL CHARGES\n\n2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was\ncomprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and\n$5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with\nconsolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing\nfunctions.\n\n1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions\nresulting in a charge to operations of $21 million. The net restructuring charge\nof $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects $3 million\nof excess reserves related to prior restructuring actions. The $21 million cost\nof these actions was comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges\nassociated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center and\n$10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development\nagreements previously discontinued.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve\nthe flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final\nassembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These\nrestructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations\nof approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999. The charge was\ncomprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees\ninvoluntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to\nbe disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions\nresulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees.\n\nEXECUTIVE BONUS\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a\nspecial executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past\nservices in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of\napproximately $90 million, the majority of which is not tax deductible.\nApproximately half of\n\n                                       17\n##PAGE\nthe total charge is the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents all\nother costs and taxes associated with the bonus.\n\nINTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n\nNet interest income increased $116 million or 133% to $203 million during 2000\nas compared to 1999. This increase is attributable to three principal factors.\nFirst, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\nincreased $801 million or 25% during 2000. Second, the weighted-average interest\nrate earned by the Company on its cash equivalents and short-term investments\nincreased to 6.55% as of the end of 2000 compared to 5.38% at the end of 1999.\nThe combination of these first two factors increased interest income during 2000\nby $66 million. Third, interest expense declined $26 million during 2000 as a\nresult of the conversion of approximately $661 million of the Company's\nconvertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of 1999.\n\nDuring 1999, the Company experienced a $59 million increase in net interest\nincome, primarily the result of higher cash and investment balances, and by\ndecreased interest expense associated with the conversion of the convertible\nsubordinated notes during the third quarter of 1999.\n\nGAIN FROM SALE OF INVESTMENT\n\nThe Company holds a significant equity investment in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a\npublicly held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design and licensing\nof high performance microprocessors and related technology. As of September 30,\n2000, the Company holds 34.8 million shares of ARM stock valued at\n$383 million.\n\nDuring 2000, the Company sold a total of 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for\nnet proceeds of approximately $372 million, recorded a gain before taxes of\napproximately $367 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately\n$94 million. During 1999, the Company sold a total of 163 million shares of ARM\nstock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before\ntaxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of\napproximately $25 million.\n\nDuring 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London\nStock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of the\nshares it held in ARM at that time for a gain before foreign taxes of\napproximately $24 million. The Company also recognized during 1998 other income\nof approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest\nin the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering.\n\nFurther information related to the Company's investment in ARM and gains\nrecognized related to that investment may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this\nForm 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which\ninformation is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nAs of September 30, 2000, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from\ndeductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $466 million\nbefore being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on\nthe Company's balance sheet. This asset is generally realizable based on the\nability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of September 30, 2000, a\nvaluation allowance of $33 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset\nfor the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance\nrelates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT, the\nutilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal\nRevenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the\ndeferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the\nvaluation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for 2000 was 28% compared\nto the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the\npreviously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign\nearnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided.\n\n                                       18\n##PAGE\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax deficiencies\nfor the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments\nthereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions\nwith the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now\nbeen resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the\nyears 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been\nresolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the\nCompany. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn June 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133,\n\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" was issued. SFAS\nNo. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative\ninstruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires\nan entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the\nstatement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value.\nDerivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.\nIf the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in\nfair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged\nassets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in\nother comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. In\nJune 1999, SFAS No. 137, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging\nActivities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133,\" was\nissued. The statement deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until the\nfirst quarter of fiscal 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 133, \"Accounting\nfor Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\" as of October 1, 2000. Net\nof the related income tax effect, the adoption of SFAS No. 133 is expected to\nhave a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of\napproximately $12 million and a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to\nother comprehensive income of $15 million. Management does not believe that\nadoption of SFAS No. 133 will significantly alter the Company's hedging\nstrategies. However, its application may increase the volatility of other income\nand expense and other comprehensive income.\n\nIn December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting\nBulletin (SAB) No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.\" SAB 101,\nas amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted\naccounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and\nprovides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative\nliterature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. The Company\nwill adopt SAB 101 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. Adoption of this\nguidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial\nposition or results of operations.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics for\neach of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):\n\n\n\n                                                                2000       1999       1998\n                                                              --------   --------   --------\n                                                                           \nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments..........   $4,027     $3,226     $2,300\nAccounts receivable, net....................................   $  953     $  681     $  955\nInventory...................................................   $   33     $   20     $   78\nWorking capital.............................................   $3,494     $2,736     $2,178\nDays sales in accounts receivable(a)........................       46         46         56\nDays of supply in inventory(b)..............................        2          2          6\nOperating cash flow.........................................   $  826     $  798     $  775\n\n\n------------------------\n\n(a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales\n    for each period.\n\n(b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each\n    period.\n\n                                       19\n##PAGE\nAs of September 30, 2000, the Company had $4.027 billion in cash, cash\nequivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $801 million or 25% over\nthe same balances at the end of 1999. During 2000, the Company's primary source\nof cash was $826 million in cash flows from operating activities. Cash generated\nby operations was primarily from net income and increases in accounts payable\nand other current liabilities partially offset by an increase in accounts\nreceivable. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 30,\n2000 and September 25, 1999 include $7 million and $4 million, respectively,\npledged primarily as collateral against outstanding derivative positions.\n\nIn addition to the net purchase of short-term investments of $936 million, net\ncash used by investing activities consisted primarily of $232 million for the\npurchase of long-term investments, including $200 million invested in EarthLink\nNetwork, Inc. (EarthLink) discussed below, and $107 million for the purchase of\nfixed assets. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from sales of\nARM shares of $372 million. The Company currently expects capital expenditures\nto increase to approximately $225 million during 2001 to accommodate information\nsystems enhancements and strategic initiatives.\n\nIn July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company\nto repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does\nnot obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire\nshares over any specified period of time. During 2000, the Company repurchased a\ntotal of 2.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $116 million.\nSince inception of the plan, the Company has repurchased a total of\n5.05 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $191 million.\n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term\ninvestments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next\ntwelve months, including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan.\nHowever, given the Company's current non-investment grade debt ratings (Standard\nand Poor's Rating Agency of BB and Moody's Investor Services of Ba2), if the\nCompany should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can be no assurance\nsuch borrowings could be obtained at favorable rates. The inability to obtain\nsuch borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the\nCompany's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nNON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company holds significant investments in ARM, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd,\nAkamai Technologies, Inc., and EarthLink. These investments are reflected in the\nconsolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have\nbeen categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair\nvalue with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the\nsale of these investments have been included in other income. The combined fair\nvalue of these investments was $786 million and $339 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2000, and September 25, 1999, respectively. The Company believes\nit is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair\nvalue of these investments in the future.\n\nFurther information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity\ninvestments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated\nby reference.\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the\nCompany's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance\nshould not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and\ninvestors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in\nfuture periods.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by\naggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent\nintroduction of new products, short product life cycles,\n\n                                       20\n##PAGE\ncontinual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price\nsensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The\nCompany's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the\nfuture may continue to be, adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures\nand downward pressures on gross margins. The personal computer industry has also\nbeen characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality,\nhardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry\nstandards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place\nmore reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are\nsmaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market\nshare with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company\nhave either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the\nCompany's key market segments, including consumer, education, and design and\npublishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced\nor announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design,\ntechnical features, and solutions of the Company's products. Many of the\nCompany's competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and\ntechnological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed\ncustomer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, the Company's future\noperating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for\npersonal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over\nanother or one set of product features over another.\n\nThe Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS\nhas a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated\nby makers of computers utilizing Microsoft Windows operating systems. The\nCompany's future operating results and financial condition are substantially\ndependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh\nplatform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over\ncompeting platforms.\n\nPRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS\n\nDue to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is\ncharacterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological\nadvances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies\nand enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new\nproduct introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market\nacceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product\ntransitions, the availability of application software for new products, the\neffective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product\ndemand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet\nanticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other\ndefects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot\ndetermine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its\nsales or results of operations.\n\nDuring 2001, the Company plans to introduce a new client operating system, Mac\nOS X, which will offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software\ntechnologies. Inability to successfully introduce Mac OS X on a timely basis,\ngain customer acceptance, obtain the commitment of developers to transition\nexisting applications to run on Mac OS X, or ensure adequate\nbackward-compatibility of Mac OS X with applications authored for previous\nversion of the Mac OS, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating\nresults and financial condition.\n\nINVENTORY AND SUPPLY\n\nThe Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that\nhave become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable\nvalue and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for\ninventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory\nand related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of\nproduct obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the\nCompany will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition,\nsuch charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's\nfinancial position and results of operations.\n\n                                       21\n##PAGE\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in\nadvance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and\nsubject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will\nforecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or\ninsufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry\npractice, components are normally acquired through purchase orders typically\ncovering the Company's requirements for periods from 30 to 130 days. The\nCompany's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and\nmay in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to\nmanage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand\npatterns.\n\nThe Company ended 2000 with substantially more inventory in its distribution\nchannels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through of the\nCompany's products during the fourth quarter. The Company currently anticipates\na significant sequential decline in quarterly net sales during the first quarter\nof fiscal 2001, in part due to the Company's plan to reduce substantially the\nlevel of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of\nfiscal 2000 to more normal levels by the end of the first quarter.\n\nMany of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by\nthird-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its\ntransportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may\nlower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct\ncontrol over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such\ndiminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products\nmanufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market\nconditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain\nprovisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least\ninitially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the\nevent of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty\nliability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or\notherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and\nfinancial condition.\n\nAlthough certain components essential to the Company's business are generally\navailable from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors\nand application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are currently obtained\nby the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components\n(including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and\nmagnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple\nsources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing\npressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially\nutilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has\nevaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional\nsuppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies,\ninitial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields\nhave matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry\nalso compete for various components with other industries (such as the cellular\nphone and automotive industries) that have experienced increased demand for\ntheir products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest\nof the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs).\nContinued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to\ndecide to concentrate on the production of components other than those\ncustomized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component\nwere to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's\nresults of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected,\ndepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original\nsource, or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an\nalternate source.\n\nThe Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also\ndependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of\nthe PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to\nprovide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with\nprice/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the\nCompany's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers\nof microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating\nsystems. Apple has been unable to ship Macintosh systems with PowerPC G4\n\n                                       22\n##PAGE\nmicroprocessors running above 500 megahertz since such systems were first\nannounced in August of 1999 due to its G4 microprocessor supplier's inability to\nprovide the Company with faster G4 microprocessors. Similar but less pronounced\nsupply issues have also arisen with the Company's supply of faster PowerPC G3\nmicroprocessors. The Company believes that this inability to obtain faster\nmicroprocessors had an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations\nduring 2000, particularly towards the end of the fiscal year. The Company has\nbeen informed by its suppliers that faster microprocessors will be available in\nsufficient quantity beginning in the first half of calendar 2001. However, no\nassurance can be given that such faster microprocessors will actually be\navailable or be available in sufficient quantities, and the inability of the\nCompany to obtain faster microprocessors in sufficient quantities during 2001\nmay have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product\nmay be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Raw\nMaterials,\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements at Note 9 under the subheading \"Concentrations\nin the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product,\" which information\nis hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nEDUCATION MARKET\n\nSeveral competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their\nintention to target the education market for personal computers. As a result,\nthe Company's overall share of this market has declined. Additionally, net sales\nin the Company's education market fell short of expectations by approximately\n$60 million during the fourth quarter of 2000, primarily as a result of the\nCompany's transition to a more direct sales model from a model heavily dependent\non third party sales agents. Although the Company has initiated a plan to\nstrengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that\nthe Company will be able to increase its share of the education market or\nmaintain its existing share of that market. Failure to increase or maintain\nmarket share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the Company's\noperating results and financial condition.\n\nMARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national\nand regional retailers and cataloguers. In addition, the Company also sells many\nof its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major\nmarkets to consumers, certain education customers, and certain resellers either\ndirectly or through its on-line stores around the world. Many of the Company's\nsignificant resellers operate on narrow product margins, and may distribute\nproducts from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial\nresults could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these\nresellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease\ndistribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for\nthe Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing\nof the Company's products.\n\nFurther information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution\nmay be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Markets and\nDistribution,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference.\n\nGLOBAL MARKET RISKS\n\nA large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international\noperations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition\ncould be significantly affected by risks associated with international\nactivities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax\nlaws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of\nthe U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and\ngoods and services are purchased. Historically, the Company's primary exposure\nto movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated\nsales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and\nnon-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world.\nWeaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen\n\n                                       23\n##PAGE\nand the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products\nand the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales.\nConversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can effect the\ncost to the Company of product components, negatively impacting the Company's\nresults of operations.\n\nFurther information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in\nPart II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Foreign Currency Risk\"\nand may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated\nby reference.\n\nSUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS\n\nThe Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's\npersonal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the\navailability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company\nalso believes the availability of third-party application software for the\nCompany's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers'\nperception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and\nupgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the\nlarger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived\nstrength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that\nmay be generated, and the costs of developing such software products. To the\nextent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market\nshare held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the\nCompany's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software\ndevelopers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market,\ndevelopers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade\nexisting software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their\nresources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. In\naddition, past and future development by the Company of its own software\napplications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software\ndevelopers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for\nthe Company's products. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce Mac OS\nX during 2001 could cause software developers to stop developing software for\nthe current Mac OS, and there can be no assurance software developers will\ndecide to develop software for Mac OS X on a timely basis or at all.\n\nIn August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross\nlicensing and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years\nfrom August 1997, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of\nMacintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft will make future versions of\nits Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although\nMicrosoft has announced its intention to do so, these agreements do not require\nMicrosoft to produce future versions of its products that are optimized to run\non Mac OS X. The Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS\nsystem software releases and make that product the default Internet browser for\nsuch Mac OS releases. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft\nhas been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to\nincrease the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a\nlimited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company competes\nwith Microsoft, including the Windows platform. Accordingly, Microsoft's\ninterest in producing application software for the Mac OS, including Mac OS X,\nnot covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be\ninfluenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the\nWindows operating system. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an\nadverse effect on, among other things, the Company's relationship with other\npartners. There can be no assurance that the benefits to the Company of the\nMicrosoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages.\n\nPATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nMany of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property\nobtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or\nrenew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods,\nthe Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such\nlicenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because\nof technological changes\n\n                                       24\n##PAGE\nin the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate\nof issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's\nproducts and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of\nothers. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be\ninfringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others.\nHowever, no litigation has arisen out of any of these claims that has had, or is\nexpected to have, an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and\nfinancial condition. The Company believes that any necessary patent or other\nrights could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be\nno assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms,\nif at all, or that the Company would prevail in any such challenge. The failure\nto obtain necessary licenses or other rights, or litigation arising out of such\nclaims, could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial\ncondition.\n\nPRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, AND CHANNEL MIX\n\nThe Company's profit margins vary among its products, its geographic markets,\nand its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the\nCompany in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic,\nand channel mix reflected in that period's net sales.\n\nINTRA-QUARTER SALES CYCLE\n\nApple generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than\nit does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal\ncomputer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's\ninternal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely\nimpact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately.\nDevelopments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the\nCompany's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the\nCompany's key logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse\nimpacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition.\n\nDEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL\n\nMuch of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and\navailability of skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and\nstaff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry\nare in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in\nthe Silicon Valley, where many of the Company's employees are located. There can\nbe no assurance that the company will be able to successfully attract and retain\nthe key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive\nperformance in the Company's stock price may adversely affect its ability to\nretain key employees.\n\nMINORITY INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Company holds minority investments in several public companies including\nSamsung Electronics Co., Akamai Technologies, Inc., EarthLink, and ARM Holdings\nplc. The combined fair market value of these investments was approximately\n$786 million as of September 30, 2000. The Company has categorized its\ninvestments in these companies as available-for-sale requiring the investments\nbe carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported\nas a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These investments are\nin publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant\nvolatility. While the overall financial impact of these investments has been\npositive through the end of 2000, adverse changes in general market conditions\nor poor operating results of the underlying companies could result in the\nCompany's inability to ultimately realize the gains associated with the carrying\nvalue of these investments. Permanent impairment in the value of one or all of\nthese investments could cause the Company to recognize a loss on some portion of\nits original $316 million investment remaining in these four companies.\n\nEURO TRANSITION\n\nOn January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union\nadopted the Euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion\nrates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro is now\ntraded on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. The\ntransition period for introduction of the Euro ends on January 1, 2002.\n\n                                       25\n##PAGE\nThe Company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities, review the\nability of financial institution vendors to support Euro transactions, and\nexamine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the\nEuro conversion. Additionally, the Company has begun the process of updating its\ninternal systems and processes to accommodate full transition to the Euro as the\ntransaction and reporting currency for its affected European subsidiaries. The\ntransition to the Euro may have competitive implications on the Company's\npricing and marketing strategies, the impact of which are not known at this\ntime. Additionally, the Company is at risk to the extent its principal European\nsuppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the\nEuro transition. Adoption of the Euro and the costs incurred to prepare for that\nadoption are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's\nresults of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance\nall issues related to the Euro conversion have been identified or that adoption\nissues identified will be addressed properly or on a timely basis. Failure to\nproperly identify and address issues associated with adoption of the Euro could\nhave a material adverse affect on the Company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\n\nVOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE\n\nThe Company's stock has experienced substantial price volatility as a result of\nvariations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result\nof announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock\nmarket has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected\nthe market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated\nto the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as\ngeneral economic and political conditions, may materially adversely affect the\nmarket price of the Company's common stock in the future.\n\nOTHER FACTORS\n\nThe majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate\nheadquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major\nvendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results\nand financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a\nmajor earthquake.\n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject\nthe Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances,\nthe requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to\nthe Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for\nenvironmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the\nCompany does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on\nthe nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be\ngiven such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the\nenvironment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n"}, "2002": {"item1": " Item 1.

Rendezvous support is built into Mac OS X Jaguar. \n\nApple Remote Desktop&#153; for Mac OS X software enables users, teachers and administrators to remotely manage other Macintosh systems anywhere on a local network, AirPort wireless network or across the Internet. With Apple Remote Desktop, teachers can view students' computer screens, perform group demonstrations and help individuals with real-time screen-sharing, text chat and the \"request attention\" command. System administrators can provide remote assistance, get comprehensive system profiles, reconfigure system settings and quickly and easily distribute software applications across hundreds of computers&#151;all from one central location over both Ethernet and AirPort wireless networks. Apple Remote Desktop supports multiple levels of administrator access, each with its own password, providing a secure way for teachers or department-level administrators to assist users while restricting privileges for deleting items or changing system settings. \n\nThe Company invented FireWire&#174; technology, also referred to as IEEE 1394, which is a high-speed serial input/output technology for connecting digital devices such as digital camcorders and cameras to desktop and portable computers. With its high data-transfer speed and \"hot plug-and-play\" capability, FireWire has become an established cross-platform industry standard for both consumers and professionals and is the data interface of choice for today's digital video and audio devices, as well as external hard drives and other high-speed peripherals. Industry data indicates that FireWire will be included on more than 64 million personal computers and nearly 100 million digital devices by the end of calendar 2002. The Company received a 2001 Primetime Emmy Engineering Award for FireWire's impact on the television industry. FireWire is currently included on all Macintosh systems and is the data transfer technology utilized by iPod. \n\nThird-Party Software Products \n\nThousands of third-party software titles and solutions are available for the Macintosh platform. The Company sells a variety of these third-party software products directly to end users through both its retail and online stores. Additional information regarding the Company's relationship with and dependence upon third-party software developers, including Microsoft Corporation, may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nProduct Support and Services \n\nAppleCare &#174; offers a range of support options for Apple customers. These options include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information as well as technical assistance, and the AppleCare Protection Plan. The AppleCare Protection Plan is a fee-based service that typically includes three years of phone support and hardware repairs, dedicated web-based support resources, and user diagnostic tools. \n\nApple Training offers comprehensive system administration and development training on Apple technologies, together with certification programs that test customers' skills and verify their technical proficiency. Apple Professional Services offers a range of custom, personalized technical services, including Internet consulting and setup, installation and integration services. The Company also offers specialized loan programs including loans for consumers, students, and educators. Apple also provides leasing \n\nsolutions for its education institution customers and its business and professional customers. The Company uses several third-party lenders to originate and carry these loans and leases. \n\nSpecialized Education Products and Services \n\nThe Company offers a variety of unique services and products to its education customers, including a separate online store for education customers offering special education price lists and promotions; special financing programs for K-12 and higher education students, faculty, and staff; a special edition of its productivity software suite, AppleWorks, that is cross platform for both Macintosh and Windows computers; the iBook Wireless Mobile Lab that allows teachers and students to share iBook computers, a printer, and a wireless network/Internet connection stored on a cart for mobility between classrooms; and three special Digital Media Studio solutions designed for education, including one that is integrated into a mobile cart. Additionally, Apple Professional Services offers a range of technical services to education customers. \n\nIn 2001, Apple acquired PowerSchool Inc., a privately held provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and school districts. PowerSchool &#174; software products give school administrators and teachers the ability to easily and cost-effectively manage student records and give parents real-time access to track their children's performance via the Internet. PowerSchool offers the option of remote hosting with an application service provider model. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh computers for a variety of reasons, including the reduced amount of training resulting from the Macintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, advanced graphics capabilities, industrial design features of the Company's hardware products, and ability of Macintosh computers to network and communicate with other computer systems and environments. Apple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in the late 1970s. Over 21% of the Company's net sales in 2002 were to education customers in the United States, including sales to elementary and secondary schools and college and university customers. Further information relating to the U.S. education market and the Company's position in that market may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers. During 2000 a single distributor, Ingram Micro Inc., accounted for approximately 11.5% of net sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales during 2000, and no individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2002 or 2001. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, businesses, and certain resellers through its retail stores in the United States, or through one of its online stores around the world. Net sales attributable to the Company's online stores totaled approximately $2.4 billion and $2.0 billion for fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The market for the design, manufacture, and sale of personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software development, which have substantially increased the capabilities and applications of these products, and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products and significant price, feature, and performance competition. Over the past several years price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing products. The Company's results \n\nof operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. \n\nThe principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. \n\nThe Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. \n\nFurther information relating to the competitive conditions of the personal computing industry and the Company's competitive position in that market place may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nRaw Materials \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These formal and informal commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. \n\nThe Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Elite Computer Systems Co., Inc., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Motorola, Inc., Nvidia Corp., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Solectron Corporation, and Toshiba Corporation. \n\nFurther discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition,\" and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 10 under the subheading \"Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product.\" \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company's research and development expenditures, before any charges for purchased in-process research and development, totaled $446 million, $430 million, and $380 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. \n\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses \n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for \"Apple,\" the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple color logo, \"Macintosh,\" and numerous other product trademarks and service marks. In 1986, the Company acquired ownership of the trademark \"Macintosh\" for use in connection with computer products. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nMany of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. \n\nInformation regarding claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and risks related to the Company's reliance on third-party intellectual property is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K, and in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nForeign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data \n\nThe United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 57% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 2002 came from sales to customers inside the United States. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\nInformation regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data.\" Additional information regarding the risks associated with international operations is set forth in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nSeasonal Business \n\nAlthough the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the school year. However, over the past two years the Company has not experienced these seasonal fluctuations in net sales due to the negative impact of current economic conditions on the overall demand for the Company's products. Past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance. \n\nWarranty \n\nThe Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end user. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the Company's major markets. \n\nBacklog \n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. \n\nEnvironmental Laws \n\nCompliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the subject of these laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\nThe parliament of the European Union is working to finalize the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes manufacturers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European Union governments by 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. \n\nEmployees \n\nAs of September 28, 2002, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 10,211 employees and an additional 2,030 temporary employees and contractors. \n\n", "item1A": "Section not found", "item7": " Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThis section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition\" below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company's fiscal calendar. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and the Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the Company's management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \n\nManagement believes the following to be critical accounting policies. That is, they are both important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition , as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements . SAB 101, as amended, summarizes certain of the SEC's views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry. \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Revenue on multiple element sales arrangements is allocated to various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each element of the transaction and is recognized as each element is delivered. \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end user rebates and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer \n\nincentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible, the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. \n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management's assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company's distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer's financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each period that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product lifecycle status, product development plans, and component cost trends. The personal computer industry is subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence. If future demand or market conditions for the Company's products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are made. \n\nThe Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been canceled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These formal and informal commitments typically cover the Company's requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company's products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company's products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees, negatively affecting gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. \n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangibles \n\nThe Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be \n\nimpaired, the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value. Although the Company has recognized no material impairment adjustments related to its property, plant, and equipment or identifiable intangibles during the past three fiscal years, except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions, deterioration in the Company's business in a geographic region or business segment in the future, including deterioration in the performance of individual retail stores, could lead to such impairment adjustments in the future periods in which such business issues are identified. \n\nAs of September 28, 2002, the Company had $85 million in goodwill. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , in the first quarter of fiscal 2002. As a result, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill but instead performs a review of goodwill for impairment annually, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. The review of goodwill for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires that: (1) goodwill be allocated to various business units of the Company's business to which it relates; (2) the Company estimate the fair value of those business units to which the goodwill relates; and (3) the Company determine the book value of those business units. If the estimated fair value of business units with allocated goodwill is determined to be less than their book value, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of those business units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business. This requires independent valuation of certain internally developed and unrecognized assets including in-process research and development and developed technology. Once this process is complete, the amount of goodwill impairment, if any, can be determined. \n\nBased on the Company's estimates as of September 28, 2002, there was no impairment of goodwill. However, changes in various circumstances including changes in the Company's market capitalization, changes in the Company's forecasts, and changes in the Company's internal business structure could cause one or more of the Company's business units to be valued differently thereby causing an impairment of goodwill. Additionally, in response to changes in the personal computer industry and changes in global or regional economic conditions, the Company may strategically realign its resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of property, plant, and equipment, identifiable intangibles, or goodwill. \n\nValuation of Non-Current Debt and Equity Investments \n\nAs of September 28, 2002, the Company held investments in certain debt and equity securities with a combined carrying value of $39 million. These investments, which are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments, have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments in two quarters during the last two fiscal years. Various factors are considered in determining whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, including the length of time and extent to which the investment's market value has been less than its cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Company's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. \n\nThe Company's non-current debt and equity investments are in public companies whose security prices are subject to significant volatility. The Company recognized a pre-tax impairment loss of $50 million related to two of these investments in the fourth quarter of 2002. As a result, as of September 28, 2002, the Company had no significant unrealized gains or losses recorded against the carrying value of its non-current debt and equity investments. Should the fair value of these investments fall below the Company's current cost bases and/or the financial condition or prospects of either company deteriorate, the Company may determine in a future period that such a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, \n\nrequiring an impairment loss be recognized in the period such a determination is made.

(b) Based on net sales associated with Macintosh units and total Macintosh units sold. Net sales increased $379 million or 7% during 2002 compared to 2001, while Macintosh unit sales were relatively flat year-over-year at approximately 3.1 million units. On a geographic basis, performance in the domestic market was relatively strong, especially when considering the performance of the Company's Retail segment which currently operates exclusively in the United States. However, the European and Japanese markets remained sluggish throughout 2002. The Company's net sales in 2002 were positively influenced by a number of factors. \n\nFirst, net sales from software, service, and other sources rose $248 million or 26% in 2002 versus 2001. This increase was driven by several factors including a 28% increase in combined third-party and Apple- \n\nbranded software sales; $143 million in net sales of iPod, the Company's portable digital music player that was introduced in the first half of 2002; a 9% increase in the sale of computer accessories; and a 14% increase in service revenue caused primarily by increased revenue associated with extended maintenance and support contracts. The growth in software revenue was primarily the result of increased sales of third-party software in the Company's retail and online stores and expansion in recent years in the number of Apple-branded software titles. \n\nSecond, overall unit sales of Macintosh portable systems grew by 92,000 units or 10% in 2002 reflecting a general trend in the personal computer market away from desktop systems towards portable systems. During 2002, portable Macintosh systems represented 33% of total systems sales versus 31% in 2001 and 20% in 2000. Growth in this area has been most pronounced for iBook, the Company's education and consumer oriented portable Macintosh system. iBook unit sales increased 14% in 2002 and 9% in 2001. \n\nThird, the Company's Retail segment grew from 8 stores at the end of 2001 to 40 stores at the end of 2002. The Retail segment's net sales grew from $19 million in 2001 to $283 million in 2002. While the Retail segment may cannibalize some net sales from the Company's preexisting sales channels in the U.S., the Company does believe that a substantial portion of the Retail segment's net sales are incremental to the Company's total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading \"Segment Operating Performance.\" \n\nFourth, the Company's average unit pricing remained relatively stable during 2002 as a result of various changes in overall unit mix offset by somewhat lower pricing year-over-year on comparative Macintosh systems. Net sales per Macintosh unit sold during 2002 of $1,462 per unit reflects the shift in mix towards relatively higher-priced portable Macintosh systems and reflects the impact on net sales of the relatively higher-priced new iMac design introduced during 2002. The impact of these changes in mix were offset by the decline in unit sales of relatively higher-priced Power Macintosh systems and by lower pricing on comparative Macintosh systems during 2002 for most of the Company's Macintosh product lines in response to industry pricing pressure. \n\nFifth, any comparison of net sales in 2002 versus 2001 must consider the effect of unusually low net sales during the first quarter of 2001. As discussed below, this was attributable to several factors at the beginning of 2001, including continuing deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers, rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during that quarter that cost the Company approximately $138 million, and a plan implemented by the Company during the first quarter of 2001 to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels that resulted in a decline in channel inventory of approximately 300,000 units during that quarter. Net sales during the first quarter of 2001 are discussed in more detail below. \n\nOffsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company's net sales in 2002 were negatively impacted by several notable factors. First, unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001. This followed a 35% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales in 2001 from 2000. The Company continues to believe that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers and that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their Macintosh applications to run natively in Mac OS X. Further, the Company did not experience the anticipated increase in Power Macintosh sales that it expected following the introduction of Adobe's PhotoShop 7 during 2002. Additionally, many professional users may have postponed upgrading their systems until after the introduction of Mac OS X Jaguar released in the fourth quarter of 2002. Others may have delayed upgrading until after the availability of other professionally oriented software applications for Mac OS X such as QuarkXpress. \n\nSecond, despite the overall increase in net sales during 2002 in the Americas, the Company continues to see weakness in its U.S. education channel. Total net sales in this channel fell 15% in 2002 and 4% in 2001. These declines are consistent with industry data that shows the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. The Company believes this weakness has been caused by multiple factors, including increased price competition in this price sensitive market from the Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers. Additionally, some of the Company's education customers appear to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy on their available funding. The Company continues to take steps to address weakness in the U.S. education channel. However, it is difficult to anticipate how this trend will affect fiscal 2003 and to anticipate when and if this trend will reverse. \n\nThird, the personal computer industry in general and the Company specifically continue to see relatively soft demand for its products. Despite an overall increase in unit sales of consumer oriented Macintosh systems during 2002, consumer sales remain far below levels experienced in 2000 and earlier. Worsening global economic conditions over the past three years exacerbated by the economic and political uncertainties caused by terrorist activities and the associated international responses have clearly had a pronounced negative effect on the overall demand for the Company's products in virtually all of its markets. Further, growth in the overall personal computer industry has been slowed due to the high market penetration of personal computers and a lengthening of consumer, creative, and business personal computer upgrade cycles. In short, the Company believes that expansion in the overall market for personal computers has for the most part stalled and that growth awaits a combination of economic recovery and technological advancements. \n\nNet sales decreased $2.6 billion or 33% during 2001 compared to 2000, while Macintosh unit sales fell 32% from 2000. Demand for all of the Company's products in all of the Company's geographic operating segments was negatively impacted throughout 2001 by unfavorable global economic conditions. On a year-over-year basis, net sales and Macintosh unit sales were down in all of the Company's geographic operating segments, and net sales and unit sales by product were down for each Macintosh product category except iBook. In addition to general economic conditions, two other primary factors contributed to the decline in net sales during 2001. First, as discussed below, the Company executed a plan during the first three quarters of 2001 to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels. As a result of these efforts, the Company's Macintosh channel inventory fell by approximately 450,000 units during the first nine months of 2001. Second, the Company believes that many of its professional users were delaying upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X, its new operating system, and in anticipation of software vendors transitioning their Mac applications to run natively in Mac OS X. \n\nSeveral positive factors combined to partially mitigate the overall decline in net sales during 2001. The net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively strong during 2001 after adjusting for the $138 million impact to net sales of the rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during the first quarter of 2001, falling only about 2.5% from 2000. The relatively strong per unit sales in 2001 reflects somewhat lower year-over-year pricing on comparative systems, offset by a shift in overall sales mix toward higher-priced portable systems. Also, the Company experienced very little shift in the mix of overall combined unit sales of relatively lower-priced consumer and education Macintosh systems, iMac and iBook, and their higher-priced professionally oriented equivalents. Combined unit sales of iMac and iBook systems accounted for 58% of total Macintosh unit sales in 2001 and 60% in 2000. Second, combined unit sales of portable systems, iBook and PowerBook, actually rose 2% during 2001 despite the negative economic climate and the overall decline in unit sales. Not only does this increase in portable system sales reflect a general industry shift toward portable systems, it is also specifically attributable to the strong demand for redesigned iBooks introduced during the third quarter of 2001 and for the Titanium PowerBook G4 which was introduced during the second quarter of 2001. Third, a small decline in net sales \n\nin the U.S. education market during 2001 compared to 2000 was partially mitigated by a 7% increase in U.S. education unit sales during 2001. \n\nFirst quarter 2001 net sales decreased 57% to $1.007 billion compared to the same quarter in 2000 and decreased 46% from the fourth quarter of 2000. Both the year-over-year and sequential declines in net sales during the first quarter of 2001 were attributable to several factors, including continued deterioration in worldwide demand for personal computers and rebate programs and price cuts instituted by the Company during the quarter that cost the Company approximately $138 million. In addition, the Company implemented a plan during the first quarter to reduce substantially the level of inventory in its distribution channels from the amounts at the end of fiscal 2000 to lower levels by the end of the first quarter of 2001. The Company ended fiscal 2000 with substantially more inventory in its distribution channels than planned due to the lower than expected sell-through of the Company's products during the fourth quarter of that year. The Company reduced Macintosh channel inventory during the first quarter by approximately 300,000 units. These factors contributed to the 52% year-over-year decline during the first quarter in total Macintosh unit sales that were experienced across the Company's entire product line. These factors also reduced the net sales per Macintosh unit sold (a function of total net sales associated with Macintosh units and total Macintosh CPU unit sales) during the first quarter of 2001 to $1,476, a decline of approximately 12% from the same period in 2000. \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's reportable operating segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas segment includes both North and South America, except for the Company's Retail segment. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the United States. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, \"Segment Information and Geographic Data.\" \n\nAmericas \n\nNet sales for the Americas segment increased 3% or $92 million in 2002. As discussed above, the Americas segment was negatively affected by a decline in U.S. education sales in 2002 of $215 million. The Americas segment also experienced a 17% decline in Power Macintosh unit sales. However, outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of consumer desktop and portable systems rebounded from the substantial declines experienced in 2001, rising a combined 31% in 2002. Sales of software, peripherals, and accessories were also up in the Americas during 2002. Growth in unit sales of consumer oriented systems during 2002 in the Americas is somewhat attributable to the significantly depressed level of net sales experienced in the first quarter of 2001 discussed above. However, growth in the Americas was somewhat negatively affected, particularly with respect to consumer-oriented systems, by the significant growth of the Company's Retail segment in the U.S. More than 70% of the Retail segment's Macintosh unit sales during 2002 were for iMacs and iBooks. \n\nThe Americas segment's 2001 net sales and unit sales declined 30% and 29%, respectively, from 2000. The operating performance of the Americas segment for 2001 reflects the Company's overall performance characterized by significant declines in year-over-year quarterly net sales and units sales, particularly during the first quarter and particularly in consumer channels, with sequential increases in unit sales and net sales during each of the last three quarters of 2001. Net sales in the Americas segment during 2001 were also negatively affected by the Company's overall reduction in channel inventories during the year. Consumer sales in the Americas were particularly hard hit by current economic conditions. Outside of the U.S. education channel, unit sales of the Company's consumer oriented iMac fell 64% in 2001. The effect of falling consumer demand in the Americas segment was partially offset by strong U.S. education sales. The Company's unit sales in U.S. education markets rose 7% in 2001 driven by the acceptance of the \n\nCompany's new portable products, particularly the iBook, and reflect a general shift in demand in the U.S. education market towards portable versus desktop systems. Portable systems accounted for 28% of total unit sales in the Company's U.S. education market in 2001 compared to 18% during 2000. \n\nDuring 2002 and 2001, the Americas segment represented approximately 54% and 56%, respectively, of the Company's total net sales and represented approximately 56% and 57%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. \n\nEurope \n\nEconomic conditions in Europe remained weak throughout 2002, and the overall demand for the Company's products in that region remained flat during 2002 versus 2001. Unit sales in Europe for 2002 reflect relatively stronger demand for consumer-oriented products, particularly iBook whose unit sales increased 27% in 2002, offset by declines in Power Macintosh unit sales. \n\nNet sales in Europe fell $568 million or 31% during 2001 compared to 2000, while Europe's unit sales fell 32%. Europe's results reflect the worsening economic climate in Europe in the latter half of 2001 and reductions in channel inventories as experienced in the Company's other geographic operating segments. Combined unit sales of the Company's consumer oriented products in Europe were particularly impacted during 2001, falling 40% from 2000. \n\nJapan \n\nNet sales in Japan remained flat during 2002 versus 2001, with a slight decline in unit sales of 2%. Consistent with the Company's other geographic operating segments, during 2002 Japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of Power Macintosh systems. Japan's iMac unit sales increased 85% in 2002. However, in the case of Japan the increase in iMac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the Company in the first quarter of 2001 discussed above. Additionally, net sales in Japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions that currently exist in Japan. \n\nNet sales and unit sales in Japan fell 47% and 46%, respectively, in 2001 versus 2000. Although unit sales and net sales in Japan have generally trended upwards as 2001 progressed, the Japan segment has been particularly affected by current unfavorable economic conditions. Reflecting the continuing harsh consumer climate in Japan, the Japan segment's combined unit sales of iMacs and iBooks during 2001 were down 58% from 2000, and professionally oriented systems unit sales fell 30%. \n\nRetail \n\nBy the end of September 2002, the Company had 40 retail stores operating in the United States, 32 of which were opened during fiscal 2002. The Company has opened 11 additional stores during the first quarter of 2003. During 2002, approximately 39% of the Retail segment's net sales came from the sale of Apple-branded and third-party peripherals and software. This compares to 21% for the Company as a whole. With an average of 35 stores open, the Retail segment achieved average annualized revenue per store during the fourth quarter of approximately $12 million and had approximately 2.25 million visitors. The Retail segment reported a loss for all of 2002 of $22 million, and a loss for the fourth quarter of 2002 of $3 million. \n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment totaled $106 million in 2002 and $92 million in 2001. As of September 28, 2002, the Retail segment had 807 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $209 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Investment \n\nin a new business model such as the Retail segment is inherently risky, particularly in light of the significant investment involved, the current economic climate, and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the Retail segment's operating expenses. Results for this segment are dependent upon a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are discussed below under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nBacklog \n\nIn the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog cannot be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the heading \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" \n\nGross Margin \n\nGross margin for the three fiscal years ended September 28, 2002 are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; 2001 &#160; 2000 &#160; Net sales &#160; $ 5,742 &#160; $ 5,363 &#160; $ 7,983 &#160; Cost of sales &#160; &#160; 4,139 &#160; &#160; 4,128 &#160; &#160; 5,817 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross margin &#160; $ 1,603 &#160; $ 1,235 &#160; $ 2,166 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Gross margin percentage &#160; &#160; 28 % &#160; 23 % &#160; 27 % ##TABLE_END\n\nGross margin increased to 28% of net sales in 2002 from 23% in 2001. As discussed below, gross margin in 2001 was unusually low resulting from negative gross margin of 2% experienced in the first quarter of 2001. As a percentage of net sales, the Company's quarterly gross margins declined during fiscal 2002 from 31% in the first quarter down to 26% in the fourth quarter. This decline resulted from several factors including a rise in component costs as the year progressed and aggressive pricing by the Company across its products lines instituted as a result of continued pricing pressures in the personal computer industry. The Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2003 in light of weak economic conditions, flat demand for personal computers in general, and the resulting pressure on prices. \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding anticipated gross margin in 2003 and the general demand for personal computers during 2003 are forward-looking. Gross margin could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained, targeted gross margin levels will be achieved, or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign \n\ncurrency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\nGross margin declined to 23% of net sales in 2001 from 27% in 2000. This decline resulted primarily from gross margin of negative 2% experienced during the first quarter of 2001 compared to 26% gross margin for the same quarter in 2000. In addition to lower than normal net sales, first quarter 2001 margins were negatively impacted by the rebate programs and price cuts discussed above that decreased revenue by approximately $138 million. Additionally, actual and forecasted declines in net sales caused the Company to recognize during the first quarter of 2001 approximately $122 million of charges associated with purchase order cancellations and loss commitments for component purchases. Without these charges, gross margin for the first quarter of 2001 would have been approximately 21%, and gross margin for all of 2001 would have been approximately 27%. As a percentage of net sales, the Company's gross margin increased each quarter as 2001 progressed reaching 30% during the fourth quarter. This pattern reflects the favorable impact during 2001 of declining component costs, especially for DRAM, hard drives, and flat panel screens. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September 28, 2002 are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; 2001 &#160; 2000 &#160; Research and development &#160; $ 446 &#160; $ 430 &#160; $ 380 &#160; &#160; Percentage of net sales &#160; &#160; 8 % &#160; 8 % &#160; 5 % Selling, general, and administrative expenses &#160; $ 1,111 &#160; $ 1,138 &#160; $ 1,166 &#160; &#160; Percentage of net sales &#160; &#160; 19 % &#160; 21 % &#160; 15 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development (R&#38;D) \n\nThe Company recognizes that focused investments in R&#38;D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. R&#38;D expense increased 4% or $16 million to $446 million in 2002 as compared to 2001. This followed a $50 million or 13% increase in 2001 as compared to 2000. The overall increase in R&#38;D expense over the last two years relates primarily to increased R&#38;D headcount and support for new product development activities. R&#38;D spending in 2002 also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $13.3 million associated with the development of Mac OS X Jaguar and approximately $6 million associated with the new PowerSchool enterprise student information system. R&#38;D spending in 2001 also included capitalized software development costs of approximately $5.4 million associated with the development of the original version of Mac OS X. Further information related to the Company's capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&#38;A) \n\nSG&#38;A decreased $27 million or 2% during 2002 as compared to 2001. The decrease in SG&#38;A in 2002 is primarily the result of lower discretionary spending on marketing and advertising expenses, decreased spending related to information systems, and benefits directly related to the Company's restructuring \n\nactions in 2002 and 2001. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales expense in 2002 resulting from increased operating expenses associated with expansion of the Company's Retail segment. SG&#38;A expenditures decreased $28 million or 2% during 2001 as compared to 2000. Declines in SG&#38;A spending in both 2002 and 2001 reflect the Company's overall efforts to stabilize and selectively reduce recurring SG&#38;A costs in light of lower net sales and to reduce discretionary marketing and advertising expenses. Given current economic conditions and the Company's continued strategic investments in new product development and its Retail segment, the Company is currently identifying additional opportunities to make appropriate reductions in SG&#38;A costs. \n\nSpecial Charges Included in Operating Expenses \n\nSpecial charges included in operating expense for the three fiscal years ended September 28, 2002 are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; 2001 &#160; 2000 Restructuring costs &#160; $ 30 &#160; &#160; &#151; &#160; $ 8 Purchased in-process research and development &#160; $ 1 &#160; $ 11 &#160; &#160; &#151; Executive bonus &#160; $ (2 ) &#160; &#151; &#160; $ 90 ##TABLE_END\n\n2002 Restructuring Actions \n\nDuring fiscal 2002, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of $30 million related to actions intended to eliminate certain activities and better align the Company's operating expenses with existing general economic conditions and to partially offset the cost of continuing investments in new product development and investments in the Company's Retail operating segment. Once fully implemented, the Company estimates these restructuring actions will result in reduced quarterly operating expenses of approximately $10 million. \n\nOf the $30 million restructuring charge for fiscal 2002, $6 million was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2002 related to actions designed to reduce headcount costs in Corporate operations and sales and to adjust its PowerSchool product strategy. Headcount actions, primarily in Corporate operations, sales, and PowerSchool related research and development, resulted in the elimination of approximately 180 positions worldwide at a cost of $1.8 million. The shift in product strategy at PowerSchool included discontinuing development and marketing of a PowerSchool product that resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized development costs associated with the product in the amount of $4.5 million. The remaining charge in 2002 of $24 million was incurred in the first quarter of 2002 and will ultimately result in the elimination of approximately 425 positions worldwide, 415 of which were eliminated by September 28, 2002, at a cost of $8 million. Positions were eliminated primarily in the Company's operations, information systems, and administrative functions. In addition, these restructuring actions also included significant changes in the Company's information systems strategy resulting in termination of equipment leases and cancellation of existing projects and activities. Related lease and contract cancellation charges totaled $12 million, and charges for asset impairments totaled $4 million. Of the total charge in 2002 of $30 million, substantially all had been spent by September 28, 2002, except for approximately $1 million related primarily to future payments on abandoned operating leases. \n\n2000 Restructuring Actions \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in recognition of an $8 million restructuring charge. This charge was comprised of $3 million for the write-off of various operating assets and $5 million for severance payments to approximately 95 employees associated with consolidation of various domestic and international sales and marketing functions. Of the $5 million accrued for severance, $2.5 million had been spent before the end of 2000, and the remainder was spent in 2001. Of the $3 million accrued for the write-off of various assets, substantially all was utilized before the end of 2000. \n\nPurchased In-Process Research and Development (IPR&#38;D) \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company acquired Emagic GmbH, a provider of professional software solutions for computer based music production, for approximately $30 million in cash; $551,000 of which was allocated to IPR&#38;D. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&#38;D was expensed upon acquisition, because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&#38;D relates primarily to Emagic's Logic series technology and extensions. At the date of the acquisition, the products under development were between 43%-83% complete, and it was expected that the remaining work would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2003 at a cost of approximately $415,000. The remaining efforts include finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&#38;D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&#38;D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. \n\nIn May 2001, the Company acquired PowerSchool, Inc. (PowerSchool), a provider of web-based student information systems for K-12 schools and districts that enables schools to record, access, report, and manage their student data and performance in real-time, and gives parents real-time web access to track their children's progress. Of total purchase consideration of $66.1 million, $10.8 million was allocated to IPR&#38;D and was expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no alternative future uses existed. The IPR&#38;D relates to technologies representing processes and expertise employed to design, develop, and deploy a functioning, scalable web-based student information system for use by K-12 schools. At the date of the acquisition, the PowerSchool product under development was approximately 50% complete, and it was expected that the remaining 50% would be completed during the Company's fiscal 2002 at a cost of approximately $9.25 million. The remaining efforts, which were completed during 2002, included completion of coding, finalizing user interface design and development, and testing. The fair value of the IPR&#38;D was determined by an independent third-party valuation using the income approach, which reflects the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the IPR&#38;D projects and that are attributable to the acquired technology, and discounting the projected net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 25%. \n\nExecutive Bonus \n\nDuring the first quarter of 2000, the Company's Board of Directors approved a special executive bonus for the Company's Chief Executive Officer for past services in the form of an aircraft with a total cost to the Company of approximately $90 million, the majority of which was not tax deductible. Approximately half of the total charge was for the cost of the aircraft. The other half represents all other costs and taxes associated with the bonus. In the fourth quarter of 2002, all significant work and payments associated with the aircraft were complete. Of the original $90 million accrual, $2.4 million remained unspent at the end of fiscal 2002 and was reversed. \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\nOther income and expense for the three fiscal years ended September 28, 2002 are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; 2001 &#160; 2000 &#160; Gains (losses) on non-current investments, net &#160; $ (42 ) $ 88 &#160; $ 367 &#160; Unrealized loss on convertible securities &#160; $ &#151; &#160; &#160; (13 ) $ &#151; &#160; Interest income &#160; $ 118 &#160; $ 218 &#160; $ 210 &#160; Interest expense &#160; &#160; (11 ) &#160; (16 ) &#160; (21 ) Miscellaneous other income and expense &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Interest and other income, net &#160; $ 112 &#160; $ 217 &#160; $ 203 &#160; Total other income and expense &#160; $ 70 &#160; $ 292 &#160; $ 570 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ##TABLE_END\n\nGains and Losses on Non-current Investments \n\nInvestments categorized as non-current debt and equity investments on the consolidated balance sheet are in equity and debt instruments of public companies. The Company's non-current debt and equity investments, and certain investments in private companies carried in other assets, have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. However, the Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings in the event a decline in fair value below the cost basis of one of these investments is determined to be other-than-temporary. The Company includes recognized gains and losses resulting from the sale or from other-than-temporary declines in fair value associated with these investments in other income and expense. Further information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nDuring 2002, the Company determined that declines in the fair value of certain of these investments were other-than-temporary. As a result, the Company recognized a $44 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in EarthLink, Inc. (EarthLink), a $6 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and a $15 million charge to earnings to write-down the basis of its investment in a private company investment. These losses in 2002 were partially offset by the sale of 117,000 shares of EarthLink stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $223,000, the sale of 250,000 shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $2 million and a gain before taxes of $710,000, and the sale of approximately 4.7 million shares of ARM Holdings plc (ARM) stock for both net proceeds and a gain before taxes of $21 million. \n\nDuring 2001, the Company sold a total of approximately 1 million shares of Akamai stock for net proceeds of $39 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $36 million, and sold a total of approximately 29.8 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $176 million and recorded a gain before taxes of $174 million. These gains during 2001 were partially offset by a $114 million charge to earnings that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of the Company's investment in EarthLink and an $8 million charge that reflected an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of certain private company investments. During 2000, the Company sold a total of approximately 45.2 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of $372 million and a gain before taxes of $367 million. \n\nThe combined carrying value of the Company's investments in EarthLink, Akamai, and ARM as of September 28, 2002, was $39 million. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future. \n\nAccounting for Derivatives and Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change \n\nOn October 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . SFAS No. 133 established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. Net of the related income tax effect of approximately $5 million, adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a favorable cumulative-effect-type adjustment to net income of approximately $12 million for the first quarter of 2001. The $17 million gross transition adjustment was comprised of a $23 million favorable adjustment for the restatement to fair value of the derivative component of the Company's investment in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), partially offset by the unfavorable adjustments to certain foreign currency and interest rate derivatives. SFAS No. 133 also required the Company to adjust the carrying value of the derivative component of its investment in Samsung to earnings during the first quarter of 2001, the before tax effect of which was an unrealized loss of approximately $13 million. \n\nInterest and Other Income, Net \n\nNet interest and other income was $112 million in fiscal 2002, compared to $217 million in fiscal 2001. This $105 million or 48% decrease is primarily the result of declining investment yields on the Company's cash and short-term investments resulting from substantially lower market interest rates. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 2.85% in 2002 compared to 5.38% in 2001. \n\nNet interest and other income increased $14 million or 7% to $217 million during 2001. The increase was due in part to interest income from higher cash and invested balances in 2001, partially offset by declining interest rates and investment yields, and a rebalancing of the aggregate investment portfolio to a higher proportion of lower risk and better credit investments. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments fell to 5.38% in 2001 compared to 6.12% in 2000. \n\nThe Company expects interest and other income, net to decline substantially in 2003 as declines in interest rates continue to impact earnings on the Company's investment portfolio. The Company's expects this decline to be most pronounced in the second half of the fiscal year. The foregoing statements are forward-looking. Interest and other income, net could differ from expected levels because of several factors, including certain of those set forth below in the subsection entitled \"Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.\" Additionally, actual future interest and other income, net may be significantly impacted by unforeseen changes in market interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and the fair value of the Company's short-term and long-term investments. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nThe Company's effective tax rate for 2002 was 25% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the research and development credit and the reversal of valuation allowances. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $369 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 28, 2002, a valuation allowance of $30 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates principally to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and other acquisitions, the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed audits of the Company's federal income tax returns through 1997. Substantially all IRS audit issues for years through 1997 have been resolved. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations , which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset. SFAS No. 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 143 for the first quarter of its fiscal 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. \n\nIn August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (Statement 144), which supersedes both SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30 (Opinion 30), Reporting the Results of Operations&#151;Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions , for the disposal of a segment of a business (as previously defined in that Opinion). SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions in SFAS No. 121 for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long-lived assets held for use and long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with SFAS No. 121. For example, SFAS No. 144 provides guidance on how a long-lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment, establishes criteria for when a long-lived asset is held for sale, and prescribes the accounting for a long-lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale. SFAS No. 144 retains the basic provisions of Opinion 30 on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity (rather than a segment of a business). Unlike SFAS No. 121, an impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 will never result in a write-down of goodwill. Rather, goodwill is evaluated for impairment under SFAS No. No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. \n\nThe Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 144 for the first quarter of its fiscal 2003. Management does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 for long-lived assets held for use to have a material impact on the Company's financial statements because the impairment assessment under SFAS No. 144 is largely unchanged from SFAS No. 121. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 for assets held for sale or other disposal generally are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated disposal activities. \n\nIn June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities . SFAS No. 146 supersedes Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs To Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Associated with a Restructuring) and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred, as opposed to when management is committed to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value. This Statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The provisions of SFAS No. 146 are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities, and may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, as well as the amounts recognized. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; 2002 &#160; 2001 &#160; 2000 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments &#160; $ 4,337 &#160; $ 4,336 &#160; $ 4,027 Accounts receivable, net &#160; $ 565 &#160; $ 466 &#160; $ 953 Inventory &#160; $ 45 &#160; $ 11 &#160; $ 33 Working capital &#160; $ 3,730 &#160; $ 3,625 &#160; $ 3,494 Days sales in accounts receivable (a) &#160; &#160; 36 &#160; &#160; 29 &#160; &#160; 46 Days of supply in inventory (b) &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; 2 Annual operating cash flow &#160; $ 89 &#160; $ 185 &#160; $ 868 ##TABLE_END\n\n(a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had $4.337 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, virtually unchanged from the end of fiscal 2001. The primary sources of total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in fiscal 2002 were $89 million in cash generated by operating activities and $105 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, offset by cash utilized for business and asset acquisitions of $52 million and capital expenditures of $174 million. \n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\nLease Commitments \n\nAs of September 28, 2002, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $464 million, $209 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Remaining terms on the Company's existing operating leases range from 1 to 12 years. Subsequent to September 28, 2002, the Company entered into additional operating lease commitments for retail space with future lease commitments totaling $65 million for periods ranging from 5 to 10 years. \n\nLong-Term Debt \n\nThe Company currently has long-term debt outstanding in the form of $300 million of aggregate principal amount 6.5% unsecured notes. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. \n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers \n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company's products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 1 to 3 months. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. As of September 28, 2002, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $525 million. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nOf total capital expenditures in 2002 of $174 million, $106 million was for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company's Retail segment and $68 million was for corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $160 million for capital expenditures during 2003, approximately $77 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company's Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. \n\nStock Repurchase Plan \n\nIn July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. During 2002 and 2001, the Company repurchased no common shares. However, during the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company entered into a forward purchase agreement to acquire 1.5 million shares of its common stock in September of 2003 at an average price of $16.64 per share for a total cost of $25.5 million. Since inception of the repurchase plan, the Company has repurchased or committed to repurchase a total of 6.55 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $217 million. \n\nNon-Current Debt and Equity Investments \n\nThe Company has held significant investments in ARM, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, Akamai, and EarthLink. These investments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as non-current debt and equity investments and have been categorized as available-for-sale requiring that they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains on the sale of these investments have been included in other income. The combined fair value of these investments was $39 million, $128 million, and $786 million as of the end of fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Company believes it is likely there will continue to be significant fluctuations in the fair value of these investments in the future. \n\nFurther information related to the Company's non-current debt and equity investments may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\nGeneral economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the Company. \n\nThe Company's operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions. For much of the past 3 years, demand for the Company's products has been negatively impacted by worsening global economic conditions. Continued uncertainty about future economic conditions continues to make it difficult to forecast future operating results. Should global and regional economic conditions fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, demand for the Company's products could continue to be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. \n\nThe terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001, disrupted commerce throughout the world and created many economic and political uncertainties that have had a strong negative impact on the global economy. The long-term effects of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Company's future operating results and financial condition remain unknown. The national and international responses to terrorist attacks, the potential for future terrorist attacks and other acts of hostility, and the potential for \n\nwar in the Middle East have created economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. \n\nThe market for personal computers is highly competitive. \n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company's competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins in order to gain or maintain market share in response to weakness in demand for personal computing products that began in the second half of calendar 2000. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. \n\nThe personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company's existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company's products. The Company has many substantial competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company's markets. \n\nThe Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsoft's Windows operating systems. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms, including Windows. \n\nThe Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues, than many of competitors. \n\nThe Company's ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technology to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell Windows-based personal computers. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company's Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company's brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percent of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. \n\nThe Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions. \n\nDue to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. \n\nDuring 2001, the Company introduced a new client operating system, Mac OS X, and delivered its first major upgrade, Mac OS X version 10.1. During 2002, the Company delivered another major upgrade, Mac OS X Jaguar. Inability of the Company to improve the performance and functionality of Mac OS X, advance customer acceptance of the new operating system and its upgrades, or obtain the continued commitment of software developers to transition existing applications to run on Mac OS X or create new applications to run on Mac OS X, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. \n\nBecause orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such formal and informal purchase commitments typically cover the Company's forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 130 days. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\nFuture operating results are dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\") are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, and optical and magnetic disk drives), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have \n\nmatured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Further, despite its efforts to educate the marketplace to the contrary, the Company believes that many of its current and potential customers believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors it utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by Windows-based systems and translates to slower overall system performance. There have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Company's suppliers to provide advanced G4 and G3 microprocessors with higher clock speeds in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company's results of operations. The inability in the future of the Company to obtain microprocessors in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the United States. \n\nMany of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service or in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. \n\nFinal assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company's manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the People's Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company's products and final assembly of all of the Company's portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and the iPod is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, environmental, political, or military conditions or events, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company's products could experience quality problems that result in decreased net sales and operating profits. \n\nThe Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that may contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications such as the Company sells often contains \"bugs\" that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third parties that may be beyond its control. \n\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. Failure to do so could result in lost revenues, loss of reputation, and significant expense to remedy. \n\nThe Company's retail initiative requires a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nSince May of 2001, the Company has opened 51 retail stores in the United States and anticipates opening more stores in calendar 2003. The Company's retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating leases commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 12 years. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment's costs are fixed because of depreciation on store constructions costs and lease expense. As a result, should the Retail segment experience a decline in sales for any reason, significant losses would result. \n\nCertain of the Company's stores have been intentionally designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company's typical retail stores. The Company has opened two such stores and has several others under development. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 5 to 10 years with total commitments per location over the lease terms ranging from $25 million to $50 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. \n\nMany of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company's control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment's future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; lack of consumer acceptance of the Company's retail approach; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. \n\nUnit sales of the Company's professionally oriented desktop systems have declined sharply over past two to three years negatively impacting net sales and gross margin. \n\nUnit sales of Power Macintosh systems fell 18% during 2002 as compared to 2001 and fell 35% in 2001 from 2000. Power Macintosh unit sales have fallen as a percentage of total Macintosh unit sales from 38% in 1999 to 25% in 2002. The Company believes that weak economic conditions over the past several years are having a pronounced negative impact on its professional and creative customers who are the primary users of such systems. The Company also believes that many of these customers continue to delay upgrades of their Power Macintosh systems due to the Company's ongoing transition to Mac OS X and in anticipation of certain software vendors transitioning their professionally oriented Macintosh software applications to run natively in Mac OS X. In addition to the negative impact on net sales, declining sales of Power Macintosh systems also have a negative effect on the Company's overall gross margin because Power Macintosh systems are generally higher priced and have higher individual gross margins than the \n\nCompany's other Macintosh systems. Continued deterioration in Power Macintosh unit sales will adversely affect the Company's future net sales and gross margin. If future unit sales of Power Macintosh systems fail to partially or fully recover, it will be difficult for the Company to improve its overall profitability. \n\nThe Company faces increasing competition in the U.S. education market. \n\nSales in the United States to both elementary and secondary schools, as well as for college and university customers, remains a core market for Apple. Net sales in these markets fell to 21% of the Company's total net sales in 2002 from 26% in 2001. This drop reflects declines in both net sales and Macintosh unit sales in these markets of 15% and 14%, respectively, in fiscal 2002 compared to 2001. These developments are consistent with industry data showing the Company losing market share in the U.S. education market in each of the last two fiscal years. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers. Although the Company has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase its share of the education market or maintain its existing share of that market. Failure to increase or maintain market share in the education market may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. \n\nThe Company's future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products. \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world. The Company also sells its own products and certain third-party products through its retail stores in the United States. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by current economic conditions. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. \n\nFurther information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading \"Markets and Distribution,\" which information is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\nThe Company's business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\nA large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. Historically, the Company's primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company's products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can increase the cost to the Company of product components, negatively affecting the Company's results of operations. \n\nMargins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\nFurther information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading \"Foreign Currency Risk\" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. \n\nThe Company's future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. In addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company's products. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company's new operating system, on a timely basis or at all. \n\nIn August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into patent cross license and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years through August 2002, and subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft was required to make versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. Although Microsoft has released Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer for Mac OS X, Microsoft is not obligated to produce future versions of its products subsequent to August 2002. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Company does compete directly with Microsoft in a number of key areas. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. Discontinuance of Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products for the Macintosh platform would have an adverse effect on the Company's net sales and results of operations. \n\nThe Company's business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company's future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. \n\nMany of the Company's products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. \n\nBecause of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected. Information regarding claims and potential litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenues and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. \n\nThe Company's profit margins vary among its products, its geographic markets, and its distribution channels. As a result, the overall profitability of the Company in any given period will depend, in part, on the product, geographic, and channel mix reflected in that period's net sales. \n\nThe typical concentration of net sales in the third month of the Company's fiscal quarters can adversely affect the Company's business and operating results. \n\nThe Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company's internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company's ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company's products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company's key logistics or components suppliers, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company's success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. \n\nMuch of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of the Company's employees are located. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully attract and retain the key personnel it needs. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in the Company's stock price may adversely affect its ability to retain key employees. As of September 28, 2002, a substantial majority of the Company's outstanding employee stock options were out-of-the-money. \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the availability and cost of insurance. \n\nThe Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional corporate insurance. Such conditions have resulted in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, and lower coverage limits. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the \n\nCompany does not have insurance coverage. For these reasons, the Company is retaining a greater portion of its insurable risks than it has in the past at relatively greater cost. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivables. This risk is heightened as economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company's outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. \n\nThe market value of the Company's non-current debt and equity investments is subject to significant volatility. \n\nThe Company holds minority investments in several public companies with a combined fair market value of approximately $39 million as of September 28, 2002. These investments are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are subject to significant volatility. The Company has categorized its investments in these companies as available-for-sale requiring the investments be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to earnings when it is judged an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. The Company has recognized material impairment charges related to its non-current debt and equity investments twice in the last two fiscal years. \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. \n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\nThe parliament of the European Union is working on finalizing the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive). The Directive makes producers of electrical goods, including personal computers, financially responsible for the collection, recycling, and safe disposal of past and future products. The Directive must now be approved and implemented by individual European Union governments by June 2004, while the producers' financial obligations are scheduled to start June 2005. The Company's potential liability resulting from the Directive related to past sales of its products and expenses associated with future sales of its product may be substantial. However, because it is likely that specific laws, regulations, and enforcement policies will vary significantly between individual European member states, it is not currently possible to estimate the Company's existing liability or future expenses resulting from the Directive. As the European Union and its individual member states clarify specific requirements and policies with respect to the Directive, the Company will continue to assess its potential financial impact. Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. \n\nBusiness interruptions could adversely affect the Company's future operating results. \n\nThe Company's major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major components suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. \n\nUnanticipated changes in the Company's tax rates could affect its future results. \n\nThe Company's future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. \n\nThe Company's stock price may be volatile. \n\nThe Company's stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and investors' concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock in the future. \n\n"}, "2003": {"item1": " Item 1.

Business \n\nCompany Background \n\nApple Computer, Inc. (&#147;Apple&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of California on January 3, 1977. The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Company&#146;s products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve G5 server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. The Company also sells a variety of third-party products that are compatible with the Company&#146;s Macintosh and iPod product lines, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital camcorders and still cameras, personal digital assistants, iPod accessories, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company&#146;s fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of September. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented in this Form 10-K is based on the Company&#146;s fiscal calendar. \n\nBusiness Strategy \n\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best personal computing and music experience to students, educators, creative professionals, businesses, government agencies, and consumers through its innovative hardware, software, peripherals, services, and Internet offerings. The Company&#146;s business strategy leverages its unique ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development is critical to facilitate innovation of new and improved products and technologies. Besides updates to its existing line of personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions, the Company continues to capitalize on the convergence of digital consumer electronics and the computer by creating innovations like the iPod and iTunes Music Store. The Company&#146;s strategy also includes expanding its distribution network to effectively reach more of its targeted customers and provide them a high-quality sales and after-sales support experience. \n\nDigital Hub \n\nThe Company believes personal computing is in an era in which the personal computer functions for both professionals and consumers as the digital hub for advanced new digital devices such as the Company&#146;s \n\niPod digital music players, personal digital assistants, cellular phones, digital camcorders and still cameras, CD and DVD players, televisions, and other consumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer include a high quality user interface, relatively inexpensive data storage, and the ability to run complex applications and easily connect to the Internet. Apple is the only company in the personal computer industry that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer&#151;from the hardware and operating system to sophisticated applications. Additionally, the Company&#146;s products provide innovative industrial design, intuitive ease-of-use, and built-in networking, graphics and multimedia capabilities. Thus, the Company is uniquely positioned to offer integrated digital hub products and solutions. \n\nThe Company develops products and technologies that adhere to many industry standards in order to provide an optimized user experience through interoperability with peripherals and devices from other companies. The Company has played a role in the development, enhancement, promotion, and/or use of numerous of these industry standards. \n\nExpanded Distribution \n\nThe Company believes that a high quality buying experience with knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the Company&#146;s products and services is critical to attracting and retaining customers. The Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company has also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which consists of the deployment of Apple employees and contractors to selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its targeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Macintosh computer and other products over those of its competitors.

This technology uses industry standard networking protocols and zero configuration technology including Ethernet or 802.11-based wireless networks like the Company&#146;s AirPort products. The source code for this technology also includes software to support UNIX, Linux, and Windows-based systems and devices. \n\nThe Company developed FireWire technology, also referred to as IEEE 1394, which is a high-speed serial I/O technology for connecting digital devices such as digital camcorders and cameras to desktop and portable computers. With its high data-transfer speed and &#147;hot plug-and-play&#148; capability, FireWire has become an established cross-platform industry standard for both consumers and professionals. FireWire is currently integrated in all Macintosh systems. \n\nProduct Support and Services \n\nAppleCare &#174; offers a range of support options for the Company&#146;s customers. These options include assistance that is built into software products, printed and electronic product manuals, online support including comprehensive product information as well as technical assistance, and the AppleCare Protection Plan. The AppleCare Protection Plan is a fee-based service that typically includes three years of phone support and hardware repairs, dedicated web-based support resources, and user diagnostic tools. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#146;s customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and \n\ncataloguers. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in 2005, 2004, or 2003. The Company also sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, education customers, and businesses through its retail and online stores in the U.S. and internationally. Over 12% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2005 were through its U.S. education channel, including sales to elementary and secondary schools, higher education institutions, and individual customers. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe Company is confronted by aggressive competition in all areas of its business. The market for personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. This market continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances in both hardware and software that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of personal computers and have resulted in the frequent introduction of new products with competitive price, feature, and performance characteristics. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers has been particularly intense. The Company&#146;s competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins to gain or maintain market share. The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition can be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide downward pressures on gross margins. \n\nThe principal competitive factors in the market for personal computers include price, relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller, simpler, and less expensive than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company&#146;s existing products. \n\nThe Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of innovations from competing platforms. The Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. \n\nThe Company&#146;s services and products relating to music and other creative content have already encouraged significant competition from other companies, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, and manufacturing resources than those of the Company. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products and distribution services, subscription services, and free peer-to-peer music services. The Company anticipates that competition will intensify as hardware, software, and content providers work more collaboratively to offer integrated products competing with the Company&#146;s offerings. However, the Company believes it currently maintains a competitive advantage by more effectively integrating an entire solution, including the hardware (iPod), software (iTunes), and distribution of third-party digital content (iTunes Music Store). \n\nRaw Materials \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (&#147;ASICs&#148;)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components, while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability constraints and pricing pressures. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, and new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components \n\nobtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. If the supply of a key or single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#146;s ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company did experience such delays during 2004 and 2005 related to PowerPC G5 processors, which resulted in the constrained availability of certain products. The Company&#146;s business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. In June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition its Macintosh computers using the PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors, which are currently single-sourced, to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. The announcement of this transition may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G5 and G4 microprocessors. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. The Company&#146;s purchase commitments typically cover its requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. \n\nThe Company believes there are several component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company&#146;s business and financial position. At this time, such vendors include Agere Systems, Inc., Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ASUSTeK Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Broadcom Corporation, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., IBM Corporation, Intel Corporation, International Display Technology, Inventec Appliances Corporation, LG. Phillips Co., Ltd., Matsushita, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, NVIDIA Corp., PortalPlayer, Inc., Quanta Computer, Inc., Samsung Electronics, Synaptics, Inc., and Toshiba Corporation. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the personal computer and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, consumer electronic products, system software, applications software, networking and communications software and solutions, and the Internet. The Company may expand the range of its product offerings and intellectual property through licensing and/or acquisition of third-party business and technology. The Company&#146;s research and development expenditures totaled $534 million, $489 million, and $471 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. \n\nPatents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses \n\nThe Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, iPods, peripherals and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and a number of foreign countries for &#147;Apple,&#148; the Apple logo, &#147;Macintosh,&#148; &#147;iPod,&#148; &#147;iTunes,&#148; &#147;iTunes Music Store,&#148; and numerous other trademarks and service marks. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the \n\nownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nMany of the Company&#146;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third-parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms; however, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained at all. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company&#146;s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third-parties. \n\nForeign and Domestic Operations and Geographic Data \n\nThe U.S. represents the Company&#146;s largest geographic marketplace. Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s net sales in 2005 came from sales to customers inside the U.S. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted in the Company&#146;s manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the People&#146;s Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacture of many of the components used in the Company&#146;s products and final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods are performed by third-party vendors in China. Margins on sales of the Company&#146;s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\nInformation regarding financial data by geographic segment is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#148; \n\nSeasonal Business \n\nThe Company has historically experienced increased net sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due to seasonal demand related to the holiday season and the beginning of the school year. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s future net sales or financial performance. \n\nWarranty \n\nThe Company offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts used to repair the Company&#146;s hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most of the Company&#146;s hardware products in all of its major markets. \n\nBacklog \n\nIn the Company&#146;s experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over-ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company&#146;s ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. \n\nEnvironmental Laws \n\nCompliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect on the Company&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member states, Japan, and California. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company. \n\nEmployees \n\nAs of September 24, 2005, the Company had approximately 14,800 full-time equivalent employees and an additional 2,020 temporary employees and contractors. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are available on its website at http://www.apple.com/investor when such reports are available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website.

Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as &#147;anticipates,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;plans,&#148; &#147;predicts,&#148; and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company&#146;s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition&#148; below. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. All information presented herein is based on the Company&#146;s fiscal \n\ncalendar. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. \n\nExecutive Overview \n\nThe Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portable digital music players along with related accessories and services including the online distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, and television shows. The Company&#146;s products and services include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPod digital music player, the Xserve G5 server and Xserve RAID storage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Music Store, a portfolio of peripherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, and a variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide through its online stores, its own retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh compatible products, including computer printers and printing supplies, storage devices, computer memory, digital camcorders and still cameras, personal digital assistants, and various other computing products and supplies through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creative professional, business, and government customers. A further description of the Company&#146;s products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this document under the heading &#147;Business.&#148; \n\nThe Company&#146;s business strategy leverages its ability, through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and many software applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around the world compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative industrial design. \n\nThe Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers, consumer electronics with its iPod line of digital music players, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Music Store. While the Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer and consumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets that are subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased investment in research and development (R&#38;D) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain and extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Company&#146;s R&#38;D spending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to its existing line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, software applications, and portable music players; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas such as rack-mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wireless technologies. The Company also believes investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness. \n\nIn June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers. The Company plans to begin shipping certain models with Intel microprocessors by June 2006 and to complete the transition of all of its Macintosh computers to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar year 2007. There are potential risks and uncertainties that may occur during this transition, which are further discussed under the heading &#147;Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition.&#148; \n\nThe Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Macintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes that providing a \n\nhigh-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attracting and retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company has expanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 124 stores open as of September 24, 2005. \n\nThe Company also staffs selected third-party stores with the Company&#146;s own employees to improve the buying experience through reseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors in reseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world. \n\nTo improve access to the iPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number of distribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can be purchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels listed above. \n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company&#146;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations require the Company&#146;s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material. \n\nManagement believes the Company&#146;s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, and income taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the Company&#146;s financial condition and results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company&#146;s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. \n\nRevenue Recognition \n\nNet sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards, including Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition , as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition. \n\nThe Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the Company&#146;s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable. \n\nThe Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue in the period the Company has sold the product and committed to the relevant program. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product returns based on the Company&#146;s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe, and Asia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company&#146;s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. \n\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management&#146;s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible . The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company&#146;s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer&#146;s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made. \n\nInventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumer electronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company&#146;s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs are recorded. \n\nThe Company accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company&#146;s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company&#146;s products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation fees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified. \n\nWarranty Costs \n\nThe Company provides currently for the estimated cost for product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures that are outside of the Company&#146;s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject to warranty protection, and adjusts the amounts as necessary. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nIncome Taxes \n\nThe Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes , the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, which, if implemented by the Company, would affect the Company&#146;s tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n\nManagement believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#146;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position. \n\nNet Sales \n\nNet sales and Macintosh unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product follow (net sales in millions and unit sales in thousands): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160;

Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2005: \n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of iPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represents an increase of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales of iPods during 2005 continued to be experienced in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments and was driven by strong demand for the iPod shuffle introduced in January 2005, the release of an updated version of the iPod mini in February 2005, the release of the iPod nano in September 2005, and expansion of the iPod&#146;s distribution network . Net sales per iPod unit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower priced iPod shuffle in January 2005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February 2005. From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company has sold approximately 28 million iPods.\n\n&#183; &#160; Other music related products and services consists of sales associated with the iTunes Music Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or 223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company has experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store is primarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, Canada, and Japan.\n\n&#183; &#160; Total Macintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005 compared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales relate primarily to strong demand for the Company&#146;s desktop products, which was experienced in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments. The Company believes that the success of the iPod is having a positive impact on Macintosh net sales by introducing new customers to the Company&#146;s other products. Desktop demand was stimulated in 2005 due to the new iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005. Net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit sales also include sales of the Company&#146;s portable products, which increased 11% and 21%, respectively, compared to 2004.\n\nNet sales per Macintosh unit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was the result of changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumer products, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop and portable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the proportion of direct sales. \n\n&#183; &#160; The Retail segment&#146;s net sales grew 98% to $2.4 billion during 2005 compared to 2004. This increase is largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 86 at the end of 2004 to 124 at the end of 2005, as well as 44% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Company&#146;s customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may elect to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Company&#146;s preexisting sales channels in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K., the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment&#146;s net sales is incremental to the Company&#146;s total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading &#147;Segment Operating Performance.&#148;\n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other hardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSight digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.\n\n&#183; &#160; The Company&#146;s U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in both net sales and unit sales of approximately 21% for 2005. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2005 relates \n\nprimarily to a 32% year-over-year increase in higher education net sales due to increased iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. The Company also experienced 11% growth in K-12 net sales due to increased iBook sales and education 1:1 sales. While net sales to the K-12 market were slightly higher during 2005 than 2004, the Company believes this market continues to be subject to budget constraints and competitive pressures. \n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of software, service and other sales rose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales in AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended service and support contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computer sales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .Mac Internet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software, and Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4 Tiger in April 2005.\n\nFiscal Year 2004 versus 2003 \n\nDuring 2004, net sales increased 33% or $2.1 billion from 2003. Several factors contributed favorably to net sales during 2004: \n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of Macintosh systems increased $432 million or 10% during 2004 compared to 2003 while net sales per Macintosh unit sold remained relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 278,000 units or 9% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases in net sales and unit sales were a result of strong demand for all of the Company&#146;s Macintosh systems, except the iMac. The Company&#146;s portable systems, consisting of the PowerBook and iBook, produced the strongest revenue and unit growth during 2004 compared to 2003 of approximately 26% and 33%, respectively. Unit sales of portable systems accounted for 51% of all Macintosh systems sold during 2004 compared to only 42% during 2003. The Company believes that these results reflected an overall trend in the industry towards portable systems. Performance of the Company&#146;s Power Macintosh systems also yielded positive results in 2004 over 2003, including a 15% and 6% increase in net sales and unit sales, respectively. The increase in Power Macintosh sales in 2004 was due primarily to the introduction of the Power Mac G5, which began shipping at the end of 2003. Although Power Macintosh sales increased from 2003, sales of this product were constrained in the second half of 2004 as a result of manufacturing problems at IBM, the Company&#146;s sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor.\n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of iPods rose $961 million or 279% during 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales of iPods totaled 4.4 million in 2004, which represents an increase of 370% from the 939,000 iPod units sold in 2003. Strong demand for the iPods during 2004 were experienced in all of the Company&#146;s operating segments and was driven by enhancements to the iPod, the introduction of the iPod mini, increased expansion of the Company&#146;s iPod distribution network, and continued success of the iTunes Music Store due largely to making it available to both Macintosh and Windows users in the U.S., U.K., France, and Germany.\n\n&#183; &#160; The Retail segment&#146;s net sales grew 91% to $1.2 billion during 2004 compared to 2003. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in total stores from 65 at the end of 2003 to 86 at the end of 2004, as well as a 36% year-over-year increase in average revenue per store. While the Company&#146;s customers in areas where the Retail segment has opened stores may have elected to purchase from the Retail segment stores rather than the Company&#146;s preexisting sales channels in the U.S. and Japan, the Company believes that a substantial portion of the Retail segment&#146;s net sales is incremental to the Company&#146;s total net sales. See additional comments below related to the Retail segment under the heading &#147;Segment Operating Performance.&#148;\n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 38% during 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computer accessories. Net sales of other \n\ncomputer accessories include AirPort cards and base stations, iSight digital video cameras, and third-party hardware products. The increase in total net sales of peripherals and other hardware was related to the overall increase in Macintosh unit sales and the introduction of new and updated peripheral products and was experienced predominantly by the Company&#146;s Americas, Europe, and Retail segments. \n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of other music related products and services increased $242 million or 672% during 2004 compared to 2003. The Company experienced strong growth in sales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overall iPod unit sales for 2004. The increased sales from the iTunes Music Store, which was originally introduced in April 2003, was primarily due to making the service available for Windows in October 2003 and the introduction of the service in the U.K., France, and Germany in June 2004.\n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales of software rose $140 million or 39% during 2004 compared to 2003 due primarily to higher net sales of the Company&#146;s Apple-branded software and in particular, higher net sales of the Company&#146;s operating system software, including Mac OS X version 10.3 &#147;Panther,&#148; which was released in October 2003. Net sales of Panther accounted for approximately $74 million or over 50% of the increase in software net sales for 2004 compared to 2003.\n\n&#183; &#160; The Company&#146;s U.S. education channel experienced year-over-year growth in net sales of approximately 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Unit sales also increased by 10% during 2004 compared to 2003. The increase in U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to a 40% year-over-year increase in higher education net sales and to a lesser extent the Company&#146;s 3% growth in K-12 net sales.\n\n&#183; &#160; Service and other sales increased $37 million or 13% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were the result of significant year-over-year increases in net sales associated with APP extended maintenance and support services, as well as increased net sales associated with the Company&#146;s .Mac Internet service. Increased net sales associated with APP were primarily the result of higher Macintosh unit sales and higher attach rates on APP over the last several years.\n\nOffsetting the favorable factors discussed above, the Company&#146;s net sales during 2004 were negatively impacted by the following: \n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales and unit sales of iMac systems were down 23% and 16%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The decrease in iMac net sales and unit sales was largely due to the delay in the introduction of the new iMac, based on the PowerPC G5 processor, primarily as a result of manufacturing problems experienced by IBM. The delays in the new iMac resulted in the depletion of inventory of the old iMac flat panel prior to availability of the new iMac G5. The old flat panel iMac form factor, which was available during most of 2004, was nearly 3 years old by the time the new iMac G5 began shipping in September 2004 and had experienced declines in sales as a result of the age of this product. The Company believes that sales of iMac systems have also declined due to a shift in consumer preference to portable systems and desktop models from competitors with price points below $1,000.\n\n&#183; &#160; Net sales and unit sales in the Company&#146;s Japan segment decreased 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 versus 2003. The Company believes these declines related to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the Tokyo and Osaka store openings in 2004. Declines in net sales in Japan may have also related to delays in computer upgrades by certain professional and creative customers pending release in Japan of certain Mac OS X native applications, such as Quark Xpress 6, which did not become available until September 2004. When sales from the Japan retail stores are included in the results for the Japan segment, the combined revenue in Japan resulted in a 3% year-over-year increase in 2004 as compared to 2003. See \n\nadditional comments below related to the Japan segment under the heading &#147;Segment Operating Performance.&#148; \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#146;s reportable operating segments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. during 2005. Each reportable geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company&#146;s operating segments may be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 11, &#147;Segment Information and Geographic Data.&#148; \n\nAmericas \n\nDuring 2005, net sales in the Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase in net sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related products and services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily by strong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from the new iMac, which began shipping in September 2004, and the Mac mini, which was introduced in January 2005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americas segment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s total net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. As noted above, the Company experienced an increase in both U.S. education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004. Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac shipments, portable system shipments, and online sales. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitive pressures, the Company&#146;s K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during 2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales. \n\nDuring 2004, net sales in the Americas segment grew 26% or $838 million compared to 2003. The increase in net sales during 2004 was primarily attributable to the significant year-over-year increase in iPod sales as well as strong sales of peripherals, software, and services. This increase was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, which had 84 stores in the U.S. as of the end of 2004. Macintosh unit sales also increased by 4% in 2004 compared to 2003, driven primarily by strong sales of portable and Power Macintosh systems, partially offset by weakness in iMac sales. During 2004 and 2003, the Americas segment represented approximately 49% and 51%, respectively, of the Company&#146;s total net sales and represented approximately 51% and 54%, respectively, of total Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in U.S. education channel net sales of 19% for 2004 compared to 2003. Strong U.S. education net sales for 2004 related primarily to strength in higher education net sales that resulted from a successful back-to-school selling season with strong demand for the Company&#146;s portables. This strength drove year-over-year growth in net sales of 40% for the higher education channel during 2004. The Company&#146;s K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 3% during 2004, despite the challenges in the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and increased competition. \n\nEurope \n\nDuring 2005, net sales in the Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing 47% in 2005 compared to \n\n2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music related products and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during 2005 was particularly strong for the Company&#146;s desktop computers, which experienced a year-over-year increase of 56%. Similar to the results of the Company&#146;s other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2005. \n\nNet sales in Europe rebounded in 2004 increasing $490 million or 37% from 2003. Total Macintosh unit sales in Europe also experienced growth in 2004 by increasing 13% compared to 2003. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europe experienced strong net sales across all product lines, except the iMac systems. Demand in Europe during 2004 was particularly strong for the Company&#146;s Power Macintosh systems and portable Macintosh systems, which experienced year-over-year increases of 29% and 42%, respectively. Similar to the results of the Company&#146;s other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and software were strong in 2004 over 2003. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan&#146;s net sales and Macintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, and other music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during 2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, which the Company believes might be attributable to a shift in sales from portables to the new iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as a result of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005. \n\nJapan&#146;s net sales and Macintosh unit sales were down 3% and 14%, respectively, during 2004 compared to 2003, which lagged behind all of the Company&#146;s other operating segments. These decreases in net sales and unit sales were believed to be attributable in part to a shift in sales from the Japan segment to the Retail segment as a result of the opening of two stores in Japan in 2004. In addition, such decreases may have been related to delayed computer system upgrades by some professional and creative customers who were awaiting the release of Quark XPress 6 for Mac OS X, which did not occur until September 2004. The decrease in net sales was partially offset by strong iPod and iBook sales during 2004 compared to 2003. \n\nRetail \n\nThe Company opened 38 new retail stores during 2005, including 6 international stores in the U.K, Japan, and Canada, bringing the total number of open stores to 124 as of September 24, 2005. This compares to 86 open stores as of September 25, 2004 and 65 open stores as of September 27, 2003. \n\nNet sales of the Retail segment grew to $2.4 billion during 2005 from $1.2 billion and $621 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in net sales during both 2005 and 2004 reflect the impact of new store openings for each year, including the opening of 38 new stores in 2005 and 21 new stores in 2004. An increase in average revenue per store also contributed to the segment&#146;s strong sales in 2005. With an average of 105 stores open during 2005, the Retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $22.4 million, as compared to $15.6 million in 2004 with a 76 store average, and $11.5 million in 2003 with a 54 store average. \n\nAs measured by the Company&#146;s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $151 million during 2005 as compared to operating income of $39 million during 2004 and an operating loss of $5 million during 2003. This improvement is primarily attributable to the segment&#146;s year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, the impact of opening new stores, and the segment&#146;s year-over-year increase in net sales, which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs. \n\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated with the Retail segment were $132 million in 2005, bringing the total capital expenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $529 million. As of September 24, 2005, the Retail segment had approximately 3,673 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of approximately $606 million. The Company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its Retail segment or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nGross Margin \n\nGross margin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 24, 2005 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 25, 2004 \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 27, 2003 \n\n&#160; \n\nNet sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n13,931 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,279 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,207 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCost of sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n9,888 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n6,020 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n4,499 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margin \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,043 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,259 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,708 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margin percentage \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n29.0 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27.3 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n27.5 \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nGross margin increased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. The Company&#146;s gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing on certain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory; an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct sales related primarily to the Company&#146;s Retail and online stores; and higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. These increases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales. \n\nThe Company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer and consumer electronics industries will remain under pressure in light of price competition, especially for the iPod product line. The Company expects gross margin percentage to decline in the first quarter of 2006 primarily as a result of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such as the iPod and content from the iTunes Music Store. \n\nThe foregoing statements regarding the Company&#146;s expected gross margin are forward-looking. There can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained or targeted gross margin levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company&#146;s product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company&#146;s ability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company&#146;s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company&#146;s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products or components. The Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition in the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company&#146;s ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchase commitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\nGross margin declined in 2004 to 27.3% of net sales from 27.5% of net sales in 2003. The Company&#146;s gross margin during 2004 declined due to an increase in mix towards lower margin iPod and iBook sales, pricing actions on certain Power Macintosh G5 models that were transitioned during the beginning of 2004, higher warranty costs on certain portable Macintosh products, and higher freight and duty costs during 2004. These unfavorable factors were partially offset by an increase in direct sales and a 39% year-over-year increase in higher margin software sales. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions, except for percentages): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 24, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 25, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 27, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and development \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,859 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,421 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n1,212 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPercentage of net sales \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n% \n\n&#160; \n\nRestructuring costs \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nResearch and Development (R&#38;D) \n\nThe Company recognizes that focused investments in R&#38;D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company&#146;s core business strategy. The Company has historically relied upon innovation to remain competitive. R&#38;D expense amounted to approximately 4% of total net sales during 2005 down from 6% and 8% of total net sales in 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is due to the significant increase of 68% in total net sales of the Company for 2005. Although R&#38;D expense decreased as a percentage of total net sales in 2005, actual expense for R&#38;D in 2005 increased $45 million or 9% from 2004, which follows an $18 million or 4% increase in 2004 compared to 2003. The overall increase in R&#38;D expense relates primarily to increased headcount and support for new product development activities and the impact of employee salary increases in 2005. R&#38;D expense does not include capitalized software development costs of approximately $29.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger during 2005; $4.5 million related to the development of Mac OS X Tiger and $2.3 million related to the development of FileMaker Pro 7 in 2004; and $14.7 million related to the development of Mac OS X Panther in 2003. Further information related to the Company&#146;s capitalization of software development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense (SG&#38;A) \n\nExpenditures for SG&#38;A increased $438 million or 31% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases are due primarily to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary \n\nmerit increases. SG&#38;A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was 13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of 68% for the Company during 2005. \n\nExpenditures for SG&#38;A increased $209 million or 17% during 2004 compared to 2003. These increases were due primarily to the Company&#146;s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, an increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising, an increase in amortization costs associated with restricted stock compensation, and higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employee salary merit increases. SG&#38;A as a percentage of total net sales in 2004 was 17%, down from 20% in 2003 due to the increase in total net sales for the Company of 33% during 2004. \n\nFiscal 2004 Restructuring Actions \n\nThe Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23 million during 2004, including approximately $14 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in asset impairments, and a $3.5 million charge for lease cancellations in conjunction with the vacating of a leased sales facility in Europe during the fourth quarter of 2004 related to a European workforce reduction. Of the $23 million charge, $19.7 million had been utilized by the end of 2005, with the remaining $3.3 million consisting of $0.7 million for employee severance benefits and $2.6 million for lease cancellations. These actions will result in the termination of 461 employees, 448 of which had been terminated prior to the end of 2005. \n\nFiscal 2003 Restructuring Actions \n\nThe Company recorded total restructuring charges of approximately $26.8 million during 2003, including approximately $7.4 million in severance costs, a $5.0 million charge to write-off deferred compensation, $7.1 million in asset impairments, and a $7.3 million charge for lease cancellations primarily related to the closure of the Company&#146;s Singapore manufacturing operations during the first quarter of 2003. Of the $26.8 million charge, all had been utilized by the end of 2005, except for approximately $1.7 million related to operating lease costs on abandoned facilities. These actions resulted in the termination of 353 employees. \n\nOther Income and Expense \n\nOther income and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 24, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 25, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 27, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nGains on non-current investments, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest income \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(3 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(8 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\nGains on sales of short term investments, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther income (expense), net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(18 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n(9 \n\n) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInterest and Other Income, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal other income and expense \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nGains and Losses on Non-current Investments \n\nThe Company previously held significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc. (EarthLink). T he Company sold all of the remaining holdings in these non-current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the sale of these non-current investments were $4 million and $10 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. \n\nInterest and Other Income, Net \n\nTotal interest and other income, net increased $112 million or 211% to $165 million during 2005 compared to $53 million in 2004 and $83 million in 2003. These increases are attributable primarily to increasing investment yields on the Company&#146;s cash and short-term investments and higher invested balances. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased to 2.70% in 2005 compared to the 1.38% and 1.89% rates earned during 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company occasionally sells short-term investments prior to their stated maturities. As a result of such sales, the Company recognized net losses of $137,000 in 2005 and net gains of $1 million and $21 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in other income were higher foreign currency hedging expenses.\n\nInterest expense consisted primarily of interest on the Company&#146;s $300 million aggregate principal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004. The unsecured notes were sold at 99.925% of par for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resulting from the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortized as of the notes&#146; maturity in February 2004. \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nThe Company&#146;s effective tax rate for the year ended September 24, 2005 was approximately 26%. The Company&#146;s effective rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., research and development tax credits, and a reduction of certain tax contingency reserves and adjustments to net deferred tax assets. The benefit from adjustments to tax contingency reserves and net deferred tax assets was $67 million. In addition, the Company recorded a $25 million reduction of the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that, in management&#146;s opinion, are now more likely than not to be realized in the future. $14 million of the valuation allowance reduction was recorded as a credit to income tax expense, and the remainder was recorded as a credit to goodwill. \n\nAs of September 24, 2005, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $767 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Company&#146;s balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. As of September 24, 2005 and September 25, 2004, a valuation allowance of $5 million and $30 million, respectively, was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax loss carryforwards that may not be realized. The remaining valuation allowance at September 24, 2005 relates principally to certain state operating loss carryforwards. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. \n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its field audit of the Company&#146;s federal income tax returns for all years prior to 2002 and proposed certain adjustments. Certain of these adjustments are being contested through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantially all IRS audit issues for these years have been resolved. In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Company&#146;s tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management&#146;s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs. \n\nOn October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (AJCA) was signed into law. The AJCA includes a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated, as defined in the \n\nAJCA. The legislation provided the Company with the option to apply this provision to repatriations of qualifying earnings in either 2005 or 2006. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effects of the repatriation provision and expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. A maximum of $755 million may be eligible for repatriation under the reduced tax rate provided by AJCA. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Company&#146;s continuing evaluation, the Company has not yet determined the amount that may be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. \n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \n\nIn November 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments . FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 amend SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations, as well as APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This guidance nullifies certain requirements of EITF 03-1, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments . FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 include guidance for evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 also require other-than-temporary impaired debt securities to be written down to its impaired value, which becomes the new cost basis. FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP Nos. FAS 115-1 and FAS 124-1, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position. \n\nIn November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs , which amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Pricing , to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). ARB 43, Chapter 4, previously stated that &#147;under some circumstances, items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges.&#148; SFAS 151 requires that those items be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of &#147;so abnormal.&#148; In addition, SFAS 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS 151, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position. \n\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued FSP 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 . FSP 109-2 provides additional time to companies beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on their plans for repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes . The Company is currently evaluating the repatriation provisions of AJCA, which if implemented by the Company would affect the Company&#146;s tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities. However, given the uncertainties and complexities of the repatriation provision and the Company&#146;s continuing evaluation, it is not possible at this time to determine the amount, if any, that will be repatriated or the related potential income tax effects of such repatriation. The Company expects to complete the evaluation in 2006. \n\nIn December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Share-Based Payment , that addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise&#146;s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such \n\nequity instruments. SFAS No. 123R eliminates the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and instead requires such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense on all awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method. In January 2005, the SEC issued SAB No. 107, which provides supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123R. SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. \n\nIn March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. The Company plans to adopt FIN 47 in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and does not expect the application of FIN 47 to have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position. \n\nIn May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which replaces APB Opinion No. 20 Accounting Changes and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements&#151;An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 28 . SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods&#146; financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is not practicable. SFAS No. 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No. 154, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations or financial position. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 24, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 25, \n\n&#160; \n\nSeptember 27, \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n8,261 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n5,464 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,566 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAccounts receivable, net \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nInventory \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nWorking capital \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n6,816 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n4,404 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n3,530 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDays sales in accounts receivable (DSO) (a) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDays of supply in inventory (b) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nDays payables outstanding (DPO) (c) \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAnnual operating cash flow \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,535 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n(a) &#160; DSO is based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period.\n\n(b) &#160; Days supply of inventory is based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period.\n\n(c) &#160; DPO is based on ending accounts payable and most recent quarterly cost of sales adjusted for the change in inventory.\n\nAs of September 24, 2005, the Company had $8.261 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $2.797 billion over the same balances at the end of 2004. The principal components of this increase were &#173;cash generated by operating activities of $2.535 billion and proceeds of $543 million from the issuance of common stock under stock plans, partially offset by cash used to \n\npurchase property, plant, and equipment of $260 million. The Company&#146;s short-term investment portfolio is primarily invested in high credit quality, liquid investments. As of September 24, 2005, approximately $4.3 billion of the Company&#146;s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate earnings from some of its foreign subsidiaries. \n\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital expenditures, stock repurchase activity, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months. \n\nCapital Expenditures \n\nThe Company&#146;s total capital expenditures were $260 million during 2005, $132 million of which were for retail store facilities and equipment related to the Company&#146;s Retail segment and $128 million of which were primarily for corporate infrastructure, including information systems enhancements and operating facilities enhancements and expansions. The Company currently anticipates it will utilize approximately $390 million for capital expenditures during 2006, approximately $210 million of which is expected to be utilized for further expansion of the Company&#146;s Retail segment and the remainder utilized to support normal replacement of existing capital assets and enhancements to general information technology infrastructure. \n\nStock Repurchase Plan \n\nIn July 1999, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. Since inception of the stock repurchase plan, the Company had repurchased a total of 13.1 million shares at a cost of $217 million. The Company has not engaged in any transactions to repurchase its common stock during 2005 or 2004. The Company was authorized to repurchase up to an additional $283 million of its common stock as of September 24, 2005. \n\nOn February 28, 2005, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2005. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. \n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations \n\nThe Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the Company. \n\nThe following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum firm commitments as of September 24, 2005 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company&#146;s balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START &#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due in Less Than 1 year \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due in 1-3 years \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due in 4-5 years \n\n&#160; \n\nPayments Due in More Than 5 years \n\n&#160; \n\nOperating Leases \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nPurchase Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n1,994 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n1,994 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nOther Obligations \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#151; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\nTotal \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,877 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n2,106 \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n$ \n\n&#160; \n\n&#160; \n\n##TABLE_END \n\n&#160; \n\nLease Commitments \n\nAs of September 24, 2005, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of approximately $865 million, $606 million of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. Lease terms on the Company&#146;s existing major facility operating leases range from 5 to 20 years.\n\nPurchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers \n\nThe Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company&#146;s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 24, 2005, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase commitments of approximately $2.0 billion. \n\nSubsequent to September 24, 2005, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion for flash memory components by the end of the second quarter of 2006. \n\nAsset Retirement Obligations \n\nThe Company&#146;s asset retirement obligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September 24, 2005, the Company estimates that gross expected future cash flows of approximately $14 million will be required to fulfill these obligations. \n\nOther Obligations \n\nThe Company&#146;s other obligations of approximately $4 million are primarily related to Internet and telecommunications services. \n\nIndemnifications \n\nThe Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company \n\ncould be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. \n\nFactors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. \n\nGeneral economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company&#146;s products and the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. \n\nThe Company&#146;s operating performance depends significantly on general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad. At times in the past, demand for the Company&#146;s products has been negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some of the Company&#146;s education customers appeared to be delaying technology purchases due to concerns about the overall impact of the weaker economy and state budget deficits on their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem to indicate an economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast future demand for the Company&#146;s products and related operating results. Should global and/or regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company&#146;s products could be adversely affected, as could the financial health of its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. \n\nWar, terrorism, public health issues or other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery or demand of products, which could negatively affect the Company&#146;s operations and performance. \n\nWar, terrorism, public health issues and other business interruptions whether in the U.S. or abroad, have caused and could cause damage or disruption to international commerce by creating economic and political uncertainties that may have a strong negative impact on the global economy, the Company, and the Company&#146;s suppliers or customers. The Company&#146;s major business operations are subject to interruption by earthquake, other natural disasters, fire, power shortages, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues, and other events beyond its control. The majority of the Company&#146;s research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, information technology systems, and other critical business operations, including certain component suppliers and manufacturing vendors, are located near major seismic faults. Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or other natural or manmade disaster. \n\nAlthough it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, such events could result in a decrease in demand for the Company&#146;s products, make it difficult or impossible for the Company to deliver products to its customers or to receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#146;s supply chain. In addition, should major public health issues, including pandemics, arise, the Company could be negatively impacted by the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations in the availability of freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement of products between various regions, delays in production ramps of new products, and disruptions in the operations of the Company&#146;s manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition have been, and in the future may be, adversely affected by these events. \n\nThe market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, as well as digital music devices and related services, is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to effectively compete in these markets, its results of operations could be adversely affected. \n\nThe personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological and product advancements by competitors, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers and related peripherals has been particularly intense as competitors who sell Windows and Linux based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for personal computing products. The Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. \n\nThe personal computer industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Further, as the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance on the Internet, an increasing number of Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company&#146;s existing products. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company&#146;s key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several of the Company&#146;s competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce digital music products and/or online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many of the unique design, technical features, and solutions of the Company&#146;s products. The Company has a significant number of competitors, many of whom have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, there has been a trend towards consolidation in the personal computer industry that has resulted in larger and potentially stronger competitors in the Company&#146;s markets. \n\nThe Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing other competing operating systems, including Windows and Linux. The Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. Additionally, if unauthorized copies of the Mac OS are used on other companies&#146; hardware products and result in decreased demand for the Company&#146;s hardware products, the Company&#146;s results of operations may be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company is currently focused on market opportunities related to digital music distribution and related consumer electronic devices, including iPods. The Company faces increasing competition from other companies promoting their own digital music products, including music enabled cell phones, distribution services, and free peer-to-peer music services. These competitors include both new entrants with different market approaches, such as subscription services models, and also larger companies that may have greater technical, marketing, distribution, and other resources than those of the Company, as well as established hardware, software, and digital content supplier relationships. Failure to effectively compete could negatively affect the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that effectively compete in these markets or successfully distribute and sell digital music outside the U.S. The Company may also have to respond to price competition by lowering prices and/or increasing features which could adversely affect the Company&#146;s music product gross margins as well as overall Company gross margins. \n\nThe Company also faces increased competition in the U.S. education market. U.S. elementary and secondary schools, as well as college and university customers, remain a core market for the Company. Uncertainty in this channel remains as several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target the education market for personal computers, which could negatively affect the Company&#146;s market share. In an effort to regain market share and remain competitive, the Company has been and will continue to pursue one-to-one (1:1) learning solutions in education. 1:1 learning solutions typically consist of iBook portable systems for every student and teacher along with a wireless network connected to a central server. These 1:1 learning solutions and other strategic sales are generally priced more aggressively and could result in significantly less profitability or even in financial losses, particularly for larger deals. Although the Company believes it has taken certain steps to strengthen its position in the education market, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase or maintain its share of the education market or execute profitably on large strategic arrangements. Failure to do so may have an adverse impact on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#146;s transition from PowerPC microprocessors used by Macintosh computers to microprocessors built by Intel is subject to numerous risks. \n\nIn June 2005, the Company announced its intention to transition from the use of PowerPC microprocessors to the use of Intel microprocessors in all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. This transition is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including the Company&#146;s ability to timely develop and deliver new products using Intel microprocessors, the timely innovation and delivery of related hardware and software products, including the Company&#146;s applications, to support Intel microprocessors, market acceptance of Intel-based Macintosh computers, the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to timely deliver Intel-based Macintosh computers, and the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand for both PowerPC and Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company is dependent on third-party software developers such as Microsoft and Adobe continuing to support current applications that run on PowerPC-based computers and timely developing versions of current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC-based Macintosh computers. The Company&#146;s inability to timely deliver new Intel-based products or obtain developer commitment both to continue supporting applications that run on PowerPC microprocessors and timely transition their applications to run natively on Intel-based products may have an adverse impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations. The Company&#146;s announcement of its intention to transition to Intel microprocessors may negatively impact sales of current and future Macintosh products containing PowerPC microprocessors, as customers may elect to delay purchases until the Intel-based products are available. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its historical gross margin percentages on its products, including Intel-based Macintosh computers, which may adversely impact the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nFuture operating results are dependent upon the Company&#146;s ability to obtain a sufficient supply of components, including microprocessors, some of which are in short supply or available only from limited sources. \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#146;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, NAND flash-memory, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers&#146; yields have matured. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have \n\nexperienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and ASICs. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company&#146;s requirements. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained on a new or existing product, the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company&#146;s ability to produce and market competitive products is dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) to supply PowerPC microprocessors and Intel to supply its microprocessors for the Company&#146;s Macintosh computers and to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company&#146;s competitors. While the Company has supply agreements with IBM and Freescale, the Company&#146;s recent announcement of plans to transition to Intel microprocessors may impact the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services, including PowerPC G4 and G5 microprocessors, which are essential to the Company&#146;s business and are currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources. Additionally, there have been instances in recent years where the inability of the Company&#146;s suppliers to provide advanced PowerPC microprocessors in sufficient quantity has had significant adverse effects on the Company&#146;s results of operations. In addition, IBM is currently the Company&#146;s sole supplier of the PowerPC G5 processor, which is used in the Company&#146;s current Power Mac, Xserve, and iMac G5 products. Freescale is the sole supplier of the G4 processor, which is used in the Company&#146;s eMac, Mac mini, and portable products. IBM experienced manufacturing problems with the PowerPC G5 processor, which resulted in the Company delaying the shipment of various products and constrained certain product shipments during the second half of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. Manufacturing problems experienced by any of the Company&#146;s suppliers in the future or failure by them to deliver components to the Company in sufficient quantities with competitive price/performance features could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products in order to remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions of the Company&#146;s existing products. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance; the Company&#146;s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, and production ramp issues; the availability of application software for new products; the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, including anticipated demand for PowerPC-based and Intel-based Macintosh computers; the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. \n\nThe Company&#146;s products from time to time experience quality problems that can result in decreased net sales and operating profits. \n\nThe Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects in design and manufacture. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those sold by the Company, often contain &#147;bugs&#148; that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the software. Defects may also occur in components and products the Company purchases from third-parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to detect and fix all defects in the hardware and software it sells. \n\nFailure to do so could result in lost revenue, loss of reputation, and significant warranty and other expense to remedy. \n\nBecause orders for components, and in some cases commitments to purchase components, must be placed in advance of customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are currently adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer and consumer electronics industries and the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may have, a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position and results of operations. \n\nThe Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company&#146;s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, and because of the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce or order from third parties excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company&#146;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company&#146;s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. \n\nThe Company is dependent on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties, many of whom are located outside of the U.S. \n\nMost of the Company&#146;s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the cost of operations, they also reduce the Company&#146;s direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured or services rendered, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company may remain at least initially responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defects. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition. \n\nFinal assembly of products sold by the Company is currently performed in the Company&#146;s manufacturing facility in Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Fremont, California, Fullerton, California, Taiwan, Korea, the People&#146;s Republic of China, and the Czech Republic. Currently, manufacturing of many of the components used in the Company&#146;s products is performed by third-party vendors in Taiwan, China, Japan, Korea, and Singapore. Final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#146;s portable products including PowerBooks, iBooks, and iPods is performed by third-party vendors in China. If for any reason manufacturing or logistics in any of these locations is disrupted by regional economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues, as well as information technology system failures or military actions, the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. \n\nThe Company&#146;s future operating performance is dependent on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company&#146;s products. \n\nThe Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers, and cataloguers, many of whom distribute products from competing manufacturers. In addition, the Company sells many of its products and resells certain third-party products in most of its major markets directly to end users, certain education customers, and certain resellers through its online stores around the world and its retail stores. Many of the Company&#146;s resellers operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by weak economic conditions over the last several years. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company&#146;s distribution and retail channel partners. The Company&#146;s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakens, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company&#146;s products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company&#146;s products caused resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#146;s products. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in various programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#146; stores with Company employees and contractors. These programs could require a substantial investment from the Company, while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue to offset this investment. \n\nOver the past several years, an increasing proportion of the Company&#146;s net sales has been made by the Company directly to end-users through its online stores around the world and through its retail stores in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and the U.K. Some of the Company&#146;s resellers have perceived this expansion of the Company&#146;s direct sales as conflicting with their own businesses and economic interests as distributors and resellers of the Company&#146;s products. Perception of such a conflict could discourage the Company&#146;s resellers from investing additional resources in the distribution and sale of the Company&#146;s products or lead them to limit or cease distribution of the Company&#146;s products. The Company&#146;s business and financial results could be adversely affected if expansion of its direct sales to end-users causes some or all of its resellers to cease or limit distribution of the Company&#146;s products. \n\nFurther information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#147;Markets and Distribution.&#148; \n\nThe Company relies on third-party digital content, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company contracts with third parties to offer their digital content to customers through the Company&#146;s iTunes Music Store. The Company pays substantial fees to obtain the rights to offer to its customers this third-party digital content. The Company&#146;s licensing arrangements with these third-party content providers are short-term in nature and do not guarantee the future renewal of these arrangements at commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Certain parties in the music industry have consolidated and formed alliances, which could limit the availability and increase the fees required to offer digital content to customers through the iTunes Music Store. Further, some third-party content providers currently, or may in the future, offer music products and services that compete with the Company&#146;s music products and services, and could take action to make it more difficult or impossible for the Company to license their digital content in the future. If the Company is unable to continue to offer a wide variety of digital content at reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules, or continue to expand its geographic reach outside the U.S., then sales and gross margins of the Company&#146;s iTunes Music Store as well as related hardware and peripherals, including iPods, may be adversely affected. \n\nThird-party content providers and artists require that the Company provide certain digital rights management solutions and other security mechanisms. If the requirements from content providers or artists change, then the Company may be required to further develop or license technology to address such new rights and requirements. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop or license \n\nsuch solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, if at all, which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. \n\nThe Company&#146;s future performance is dependent upon support from third-party software developers. If third-party software applications cease to be developed or available for the Company&#146;s hardware products, then customers may choose not to buy the Company&#146;s products. \n\nThe Company believes that decisions by customers to purchase the Company&#146;s personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications such as Microsoft Office. The Company also believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company&#146;s hardware products depends in part on third-party developers&#146; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company&#146;s products versus software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. This analysis may be based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, continued acceptance by customers of Mac OS X, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the minority market share held by the Company in the personal computer market has caused software developers to question the Company&#146;s prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company&#146;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market or growing Linux market. Moreover, there can be no assurance software developers will continue to develop software for Mac OS X, the Company&#146;s operating system, on a timely basis or at all. \n\nIn June 2005, the Company announced its plan to begin using Intel microprocessors in its Macintosh computers. The Company plans to begin shipping certain models with Intel microprocessors by June 2006 and to complete this transition to Intel microprocessors for all of its Macintosh computers by the end of calendar year 2007. The Company depends on third-party software developers to timely develop current and future applications that run on Intel and PowerPC microprocessors. The Company&#146;s inability to timely deliver new Intel-based products, or a decline in available applications that run on the Company&#146;s PowerPC products or the lack of applications that run on Intel-based Macintosh systems could have a materially adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operating results and financial position. \n\nIn addition, past and future development by the Company of its own software applications and solutions may negatively impact the decision of software developers, such as Microsoft and Adobe, to develop, maintain, and upgrade similar or competitive software for the Company&#146;s products. The Company currently markets and sells a variety of software applications for use by professionals, consumers, and education customers that could influence the decisions of third-party software developers to develop or upgrade Macintosh-compatible software products. Software applications currently marketed by the Company include software for professional film and video editing, professional compositing and visual effects for large format film and video productions, professional music production and music post production, professional and consumer DVD encoding and authoring, professional digital photo editing and workflow management, consumer digital video and digital photo editing and management, digital music management, desktop-based database management, word processing, and high-quality presentations. The Company also markets an integrated productivity application that incorporates word processing, page layout, image manipulation, spreadsheets, databases, and presentations in a single application. Discontinuance of third-party products for the Macintosh platform, including Microsoft Office could have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s net sales and results of operations. \n\nThe Company&#146;s business relies on access to patents and intellectual property obtained from third parties, and the Company&#146;s future results could be adversely affected if it is alleged or found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others. \n\nMany of the Company&#146;s products are designed to include intellectual property obtained from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products and business methods, the Company believes that based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available or available on acceptable terms. \n\nBecause of technological changes in the computer and consumer electronics industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company&#146;s products and business methods may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company has from time to time been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Responding to such claims, regardless of their merit, can be time-consuming, result in significant expenses, and cause the diversion of management and technical personnel. Several pending claims are in various stages of evaluation. The Company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these cases. However, no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting the Company from marketing or selling certain of its products or a successful claim of infringement against the Company requiring it to pay royalties to a third-party, the Company&#146;s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Information regarding certain claims and litigation involving the Company related to alleged patent infringement and other matters is set forth in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability for damages or royalties from any current legal proceedings or claims related to the infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, or financial condition. However, the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of the matters related to infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of others described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K or should several of these matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company&#146;s retail initiative has required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThrough October 2005, the Company had opened 126 retail stores. The Company&#146;s retail initiative has required substantial investment in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory, and personnel. The Company has also entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space with lease terms ranging from 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years. The Company could incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate this initiative or close individual stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a relatively high proportion of the Retail segment&#146;s costs are fixed because of depreciation on store construction costs and lease expense. As a result, significant losses would result should the Retail segment experience a significant decline in sales for any reason. \n\nCertain of the Company&#146;s stores have been designed and built to serve as high profile venues that function as vehicles for general corporate marketing, corporate events, and brand awareness. Because of their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment in equipment and leasehold improvements than the Company&#146;s more typical retail stores. The Company has opened seven such stores through October 2005. Because of their location and size, these high profile stores also require the Company to enter into substantially larger operating lease commitments compared to those required for its more typical stores. Current leases on such locations have terms ranging from 10 to 14 years with total \n\nremaining commitments per location ranging from $4 million to $46 million. Closure or poor performance of one of these high profile stores could have a particularly significant negative impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nMany of the general risks and uncertainties the Company faces could also have an adverse impact on its Retail segment. Also, many factors unique to retail operations present risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company&#146;s control, that could adversely affect the Retail segment&#146;s future results, cause its actual results to differ from those currently expected, and/or have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated results of operations. Potential risks and uncertainties unique to retail operations that could have an adverse impact on the Retail segment include, among other things, macro-economic factors that have a negative impact on general retail activity; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; failure to attract new users to the Macintosh platform; inability to sell third-party hardware and software products at adequate margins; failure to manage relationships with existing retail channel partners; lack of experience in managing retail operations outside the U.S.; costs associated with unanticipated fluctuations in the value of Apple-branded and third-party retail inventory; and inability to obtain quality retail locations at reasonable cost. \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and initiatives could disrupt the Company&#146;s ongoing business and may present risks not originally contemplated. \n\nThe Company has and may in the future invest in new business strategies or engage in acquisitions that complement the Company&#146;s strategic direction and product roadmap. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management&#146;s attention away from normal business operations; insufficient revenue generation to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with the strategy; and unidentified issues not discovered in the Company&#146;s due diligence process. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect the Company&#146;s business, operating results or financial condition. \n\nDeclines in the sales of the Company&#146;s professional products, software, accessories, or service and support contracts, or increases in sales of consumer products, including iPods, may negatively impact the Company&#146;s gross margin and operating margin percentages. \n\nThe Company&#146;s professional products, including Power Macintosh and PowerBook systems, software, accessories, and service and support contracts, generally have higher gross margins than the Company&#146;s consumer products, including iMacs, iBooks, iPods, and content from the iTunes Music Store. A shift in sales mix away from higher margin professional products towards lower margin consumer products could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future gross margin and operating margin percentages. The Company&#146;s traditional professional customers may choose to buy consumer products, specifically the iMac G5 and iBook, instead of professional products. Professional users may choose to buy the iMac G5 due to its relative price performance, use of the same PowerPC G5 processor used in the Company&#146;s Power Macs, and unique design featuring a flat panel screen. Potential PowerBook customers may also choose to purchase iBooks instead due to their price performance and screen size. Additionally, significant future growth in iPod sales without corresponding growth in higher margin product sales could also reduce gross margin and operating margin percentages. \n\nIt is likely that some of the Company&#146;s current and potential professional, creative, and small business customers, who are most likely to utilize professional systems, believe that the relatively slower MHz rating or clock speed of the microprocessors the Company utilizes in its Macintosh systems compares unfavorably to those utilized by other computer manufacturers and translates to slower overall system performance. These factors may result in an adverse impact to sales of the Company&#146;s professional products as well as to gross margin and operating margin percentages. \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate for a variety of reasons. \n\nThe Company&#146;s profit margins vary among its products and its distribution channels. The Company&#146;s direct sales, primarily through its retail and online stores, generally have higher associated profitability than its indirect sales. Additionally, the Company&#146;s direct channels have traditionally had more sales of software and higher priced hardware products, which generally have higher gross margins, than its indirect channels. As a result, the Company&#146;s gross margin and operating margin percentages as well as overall profitability may be adversely impacted as a result of a shift in product, geographic, or channel mix, or new product announcements, including the transition to Intel-based Macintosh computers. In addition, the Company generally sells more products during the third month of each quarter than it does during either of the first two months, a pattern typical in the personal computer industry. This sales pattern can produce pressure on the Company&#146;s internal infrastructure during the third month of a quarter and may adversely impact the Company&#146;s ability to predict its financial results accurately. Developments late in a quarter, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#146;s products, an internal systems failure, or failure of one of the Company&#146;s key logistics, components suppliers, or manufacturing partners, can have significant adverse impacts on the Company and its results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has higher research and development and selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenue, than many of its competitors. \n\nThe Company&#146;s ability to compete successfully and maintain attractive gross margins and revenue growth is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of innovative and competitive products and technologies to the marketplace. As a result, the Company incurs higher research and development costs as a percentage of revenue than its competitors who sell personal computers based on other operating systems. Many of these competitors seek to compete aggressively on price and maintain very low cost structures. Further, as a result of the expansion of the Company&#146;s Retail segment and costs associated with marketing the Company&#146;s brand including its unique operating system, the Company incurs higher selling costs as a percentage of revenue than many of its competitors. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive gross margins, its results of operations may be materially adversely affected by its operating cost structure. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements. This risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products through third-party computer resellers and retailers and directly to certain educational institutions and commercial customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#146;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. The Company also has unsecured non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale by the Company of raw material components to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into long-term supply agreements to secure supply of NAND flash-memory and intends to prepay a total of $1.25 billion under these agreements. While the Company has procedures in place to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance that such procedures will be effective in limiting its credit risk and avoiding losses. Additionally, if the global economy and regional economies fail to improve or continue to deteriorate, it becomes more likely that the Company will incur a material loss or losses as a result of the weakening financial condition of one or more of its customers or manufacturing vendors. \n\nThe Company&#146;s success depends largely on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. \n\nMuch of the future success of the Company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, members of its executive team, and those in technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley, where the majority of \n\nthe Company&#146;s key employees are located. The Company has relied on its ability to grant stock options as one mechanism for recruiting and retaining this highly skilled talent. Recent accounting regulations requiring the expensing of stock options will impair the Company&#146;s future ability to provide these incentives without incurring significant compensation costs. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to successfully attract and retain key personnel. \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the selection, availability, and cost of insurance. \n\nThe Company has observed rapidly changing conditions in the insurance markets relating to nearly all areas of traditional commercial insurance. Such conditions have and may continue to result in higher premium costs, higher policy deductibles, lower coverage limits and may also yield possible policy form exclusions. For some risks, because of cost and/or availability, the Company does not have insurance coverage. Because the Company retains some portion of its insurable risks, and in some cases self insures completely, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of insured limits may have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations and financial position. \n\nFailure of information technology systems and breaches in the security of data upon which the Company relies could adversely affect the Company&#146;s future operating results. \n\nInformation technology system failures and breaches of data security could disrupt the Company&#146;s ability to function in the normal course of business by potentially causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the manufacture or shipment of products, or resulting in the unintentional disclosure of customer or Company information. Management has taken steps to address these concerns for its own systems by implementing sophisticated network security and internal control measures. However, there can be no assurance that a system failure or data security breach of the Company or a third-party vendor will not have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nThe Company&#146;s business is subject to the risks of international operations. \n\nA large portion of the Company&#146;s revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company&#146;s operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. The Company&#146;s primary exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates relate to non-dollar denominated sales in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, and certain parts of Asia and non-dollar denominated operating expenses incurred throughout the world. Weaknesses in foreign currencies, particularly the Japanese Yen and the Euro, can adversely impact consumer demand for the Company&#146;s products and the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#146;s foreign currency denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening in these and other foreign currencies can cause the Company to modify international pricing and affect the value of the Company&#146;s foreign denominated sales, and in some cases, may also increase the cost to the Company of some product components. \n\nMargins on sales of the Company&#146;s products in foreign countries, and on sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. \n\nDerivative instruments, such as foreign exchange forward and option positions have been utilized by the Company to hedge exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates. \n\nFurther information related to the Company&#146;s global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading &#147;Foreign Currency Risk&#148; and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with environmental regulations. \n\nProduction and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Such laws and regulations have recently been passed in several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including various European Union member countries, Japan, and certain states within the U.S. In the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. \n\nChanges in accounting rules could affect the Company&#146;s future operating results. \n\nFinancial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These principles are subject to interpretation by various governing bodies, including the FASB and the SEC, who create and interpret appropriate accounting standards. A change from current accounting standards could have a significant effect on the Company&#146;s results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued new guidance that addresses the accounting for share-based payments, SFAS No. 123R. In April 2005, the SEC deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 123R to years beginning after June 15, 2005. Therefore, SFAS No. 123R will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of fiscal 2006. The Company expects the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will result in a reduction of diluted earnings per common share of approximately $0.03 for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. Although the effect from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations, future changes to various assumptions used to determine the fair-value of awards issued or the amount and type of equity awards granted create uncertainty as to the amount of future stock-based compensation expense. \n\nChanges in the Company&#146;s tax rates could affect its future results. \n\nThe Company&#146;s future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of the Company&#146;s deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. In addition, the Company is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse affect on the Company&#146;s net income and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#146;s stock price may be volatile. \n\nThe Company&#146;s stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between its actual and anticipated financial results and as a result of announcements by the Company and its competitors. The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, including lack of positive general economic and political conditions and investors&#146; concerns regarding the credibility of corporate financial reporting and integrity of financial markets, may materially adversely affect the market price of the Company&#146;s stock in the future. In addition, increases in the Company&#146;s stock price may result in greater dilution of earnings per share. \n\n"}}
